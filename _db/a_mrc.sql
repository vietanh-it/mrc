This is a famous cottage industry and a local delicacy, enjoyed throughout Vietnam and Southeast Asia.\r\n\r\nAs we stroll through the narrow paths of local villages, we make close, personal contact with the residents. A small fleet of a locally designed motorized ‘Tuk Tuk’ takes us on a ride through the plantations, en route to the exotic tropical fruit farms. Savor the freshest most colorful Dragon-fruit, succulent Watermelons, delicious Lychees and the notorious Durian.!\r\n\r\nA local riverboat returns us to the Mekong Princess, as we continue on our way to an even more remote destination in the Mekong Delta.\r\n\r\nLuncheon is served as we cruise along a narrow canal, regarded as one of the busiest trading routes in Southeast Asia.\r\n\r\nThis afternoon, the ship sails through an area of the Mekong Delta barely touched by tourism to see Phuoc Hau historic pagoda. You will explore a local neighborhood where the locals make products from water hyacinth, a fast growing free-floating plant in the Mekong Delta, such as slippers, furniture, baskets, purses and serving trays.');

There, they sell their fruits, vegetables, sugar cane and rice.\r\nThis location is a photographers delight. Be ready. !\r\n\r\nA brief excursion ashore follows a short cruise past the Cai Rang markets to a nearby rice noodle factory, where we see the process of noodle making.\r\nIt’s hot, steamy, ‘smelly’ and totally authentic.\r\n\r\nThe river boat returns us to the Mekong Princess for luncheon.\r\n\r\nLater this afternoon, your sampans take you to the village of Thot Not, where you transfer to a “Lambro 555” that takes you through the village, where you begin to hear the cacophony of a bird sanctuary. After a short walk into the sanctuary, you climb the steps to the viewing platform, and enjoy an incredible view over the treetops and down on the nesting area of a variety of protected birds.');

Hong Ngu produces an abundance of traditional Khmer scarves, which are exported to Cambodia. Hand-woven in many homes throughout the village, we see the intricate weaving process from start to finish. Many of the villagers are embroidery artists who display their art on the balconies of their timber homes, which are built on stilts to avoid flooding in the wet season.\r\n\r\nThe residents of Hong Ngu had rarely encountered western visitors prior to the arrival of the Mekong Princess. Their welcome is warm and naturally friendly. During our time here, we enter a local temple dedicated to a unique religion founded in this area named Hòa Hảo.\r\n\r\nWe return by riverboat to the Mekong Princess, weigh anchor and cross the border into Cambodia, cruising onwards towards our overnight anchorage\r\n\r\nAt sunset, cocktails will be served before a dinner menu of Western-Oriental cuisine is provided for your pleasure.\r\n\r\nThis afternoon, the Mekong Princess will cross the border into Cambodia and continue up the Mekong River.

We&#8217;ve been working on a lot of things, many of them to make getting your site set up the way you want it much easier. Here are some of the bigger items to test and help us find as many bugs as possible in the coming weeks:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://2017.wordpress.net/\"><strong>Twenty Seventeen</strong></a> &#8211; A brand new default theme brings your site to life with immersive featured images, video headers, and subtle animations. With a focus on business sites, it features multiple sections on the front page as well as widgets, navigation and social menus, a logo, and more. Personalize its asymmetrical grid with a custom color scheme and showcase your multimedia content with post formats. Our default theme for 2017 works great in many languages, for any abilities, and on any device.</li>\n<li><strong>Video Headers</strong> &#8211; Sometimes a big atmospheric video as a moving header image is just what you need to showcase your wares; go ahead and try it out with Twenty Seventeen. Need some video inspiration? Try searching for sites with video headers available for download and use.</li>\n<li><strong>Set up your site in one flow</strong> &#8211; From finding and installing themes right inside the customizer, to automatically staged theme-specific starter content, to clickable shortcuts that jump directly to editing an item from the preview pane, to adding pages while you&#8217;re building a nav menu or setting a static front page: getting a new site spun up and ready to share with a friend or a coworker is faster and easier than it&#8217;s ever been. Note: starter content appears when live previewing brand new sites and is currently only available in Twenty Seventeen. We&#8217;ll be expanding this to other bundled themes very soon, and perhaps to sites with existing content in future releases of WordPress.</li>\n<li><strong>Custom CSS with live previews</strong> &#8211; Ever needed to hide or tweak the look of something in your theme or from a plugin? Now you can do it with CSS and live preview the results while customizing your site. CSS can be a powerful tool; you may find that you won&#8217;t need the theme editor or child themes anymore.</li>\n<li><strong>User admin languages</strong> &#8211; Just because your site is in one language doesn&#8217;t mean that everybody helping manage it prefers that language for their admin. To try this out, you&#8217;ll need to have more than one language installed, which will make a user language option available in your profile.</li>\n<li><strong>PDF thumbnail previews</strong> &#8211; Uploading PDFs will now generate thumbnail images so you can more easily distinguish between all your documents.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As always, there have been exciting changes for developers to explore as well, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>REST API content endpoints</strong> &#8211; If you only test one thing as a developer, please test these. This phase is particularly helpful for people building plugins, themes, and in-admin interfaces. Can you build the things you need? Are these ready for release, and is the world ready for them? (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/38373\">#38373</a>)</li>\n<li><strong><code>WP_Hook</code></strong> &#8211; The code that lies beneath actions and filters has been overhauled. You likely aren&#8217;t affected, but if you&#8217;ve done things to the <code>$wp_filter</code> global or experienced funky recursion bugs in the past, <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2016/09/08/wp_hook-next-generation-actions-and-filters/\">please take a moment to read the dev note</a> and test your code.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2016/10/04/custom-bulk-actions/\"><strong>Custom bulk actions</strong></a> &#8211; List tables, now with more than bulk edit and delete.</li>\n<li>Expanded <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2016/10/26/registering-your-settings-in-wordpress-4-7/\"><strong>Settings Registration API</strong></a> via <code>register_setting()</code>.</li>\n<li>For theme developers: <strong>Post type templates</strong> (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/18375\">#18375</a>)</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2016/09/09/new-functions-hooks-and-behaviour-for-theme-developers-in-wordpress-4-7/\">More goodies for theme developers!</a></strong></li>\n<li><strong>Locale switching</strong> (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/26511\">#26511</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2016/10/11/comment-allowed-checks-in-wordpress-4-7/\"><strong>Comment allowed checks</strong></a> have the potential for a back-compat break.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you want a more in-depth view of what major changes have made it into 4.7, <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/tag/4-7/\">check out posts tagged with 4.7 on the main development blog</a>, or look at a <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/query?status=closed&amp;resolution=fixed&amp;milestone=4.7&amp;group=component&amp;order=priority\">list of everything</a> that’s changed.

Likewise, customizer controls now support notifications, which are used to display validation errors instead of failing silently.</p>\n<h3>Multisite, now faster than ever</h3>\n<p>Cached and comprehensive site queries improve your network admin experience. The addition of <code><a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/classes/wp_site_query\">WP_Site_Query</a></code> and <code><a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/classes/wp_network_query\">WP_Network_Query</a></code> help craft advanced queries with less effort.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center\">The Crew</h2>\n<p>This release was led by <a href=\"https://dominikschilling.de/\">Dominik Schilling</a>, backed up by <a href=\"https://www.garthmortensen.com/\">Garth Mortensen</a> as Release Deputy, and with the help of these fine individuals.

In an effort to see if the <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/27403\">same could be done</a> for the self-hosted version of WordPress, <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/27403#comment:16\">Payton Swick open sourced</a> Automattic&#8217;s work into a plugin and <a href=\"https://github.com/Automattic/customize-direct-manipulation\">placed it on GitHub</a>.</p>\n<p>The plugin added persistent icons to show users which parts of a site can be customized when the customizer preview pane is open. After months of collaboration between Automatticians and the Customize component maintainers, the icons were merged into WordPress 4.7 and are officially called visible edit shortcuts. The icons visually inform users which elements can be edited in a theme.</p>\n<p>The icons appear when the customizer is open and directs users to settings that control an element. For example, clicking the icon next to the site tagline in the image below opens the Site Identity section of the customizer and makes the Tagline field active. Visible shortcuts are an extension of the Shift-click to edit keyboard shortcut that was added in WordPress 3.9.</p>\n<a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/CustomizerShortcutButtons.png?ssl=1\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-63883\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/CustomizerShortcutButtons.png?resize=1025%2C544&ssl=1\" alt=\"Visible Edit Shortcut Buttons\" /></a>Visible Edit Shortcut Buttons\n<p>The icon approach was largely inspired by WordPress.com which has a similar feature in its customizer. Nick Halsey, Customize component maintainer, <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2016/11/10/visible-edit-shortcuts-in-the-customizer-preview/\">describes in detail</a> the history of the feature and what theme authors need to do to support it.</p>\n<p>Unlike many of the theme specific updates in the past where developers can add support by using add_theme_support, supporting visible edit shortcuts is more comprehensive. Theme authors will need to add support for <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2016/02/16/selective-refresh-in-the-customizer/\">selective refresh</a>, <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2016/03/22/implementing-selective-refresh-support-for-widgets/\">selective refresh for widgets</a>, and <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/07/29/fast-previewing-changes-to-menus-in-the-customizer/\">selective refresh for menus</a>.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Edit shortcuts will be enabled by default for all themes, but are contingent on themes supporting selective refresh,&#8221; Halsey said. Additionally, a small amount of CSS may be required to properly position the icons.</p>\n<p>Adding visual elements that connect parts of a theme to the customizer should take some of the guesswork out of editing themes. Instead of spending time browsing through various customizer panels to edit a part of a site, users can click a button and the right customizer panel will open automatically with the settings you need. This can be especially useful for themes that have a lot of customizer sections.</p>\n<p>I tested visible edit shortcuts using the Twenty Seventeen theme in WordPress 4.7 beta 4 and didn&#8217;t encounter any issues. The team is strongly encouraging users to test with as many themes as possible. If you use a theme where the shortcut icons are not displayed, please contact the theme author, request that they add support, and refer them to <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2016/11/10/visible-edit-shortcuts-in-the-customizer-preview/\">the make core blog post which explains how to do so</a>.</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 17 Nov 2016 08:54:19 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:3;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:49:\"WPTavern: Nashville to Host WordCamp US 2017-2018\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=63871\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:60:\"https://wptavern.com/nashville-to-host-wordcamp-us-2017-2018\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5593:\"<a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/nashville.jpg?ssl=1\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/nashville.jpg?resize=1015%2C524&ssl=1\" alt=\"photo credit: Viv Lynch Westward - (license)\" class=\"size-full wp-image-63884\" /></a>photo credit: Viv Lynch <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/68894626@N00/30070498810\">Westward</a> &#8211; <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/2.0/\">(license)</a>\n<p><a href=\"https://2016.us.wordcamp.org/\" target=\"_blank\">WordCamp US</a> attendees are counting down the days until the event kicks off in Philadelphia in two weeks but preparations for 2017 and 2018 are already underway. Yesterday Matt Mullenweg <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2016/11/wordcamp-us-2017-2018-in-nashville/\" target=\"_blank\">announced</a> that Nashville has won the bid to host WordCamp US for the next two years. According to Randy Hicks, one of the organizers, the new <a href=\"http://www.nashvillemusiccitycenter.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Music City Center</a> venue, which was finished in 2013, has been reserved from Thursday, November 30, 2017, to Sunday, December 3 but the camp will take place Friday &#8211; Sunday. The venue has confirmed the ability to host 3,000 &#8211; 5,000 attendees.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We have a brand new venue that is pretty amazing but Nashville is very centrally located to handful of other cities that all have their own WordCamps,&#8221; Hicks said. &#8220;I think there are about seven camps within 4-5 hours. The WP community around Nashville is rather strong.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Over the past few years the local WordPress community has grown and WordCamp Nashville sold 325 tickets at its 2016 event.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been coming to the meetups since the very first one and have been an organizer since about the same time as well as John Housholder,&#8221; Hicks said. &#8220;We&#8217;ve seen the community explode every year after WordCamp, but 2014 and 2015 have been huge growth years for Nashville as a whole and the meetup has reflected those numbers.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The application process included nailing down a venue, creating a budget, and gathering specific details about wifi capabilities, room capabilities, hotel availability, and date availability. Organizers from both the Nashville team and the Denver team (another finalist) agreed that the application time frame was somewhat constrained.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I thought the time frame between start and submission was pretty short, but I think that depends on who is submitting and how informed they are on their local venue,&#8221; Hicks said. &#8220;Ours was really hard to get information from.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The Denver team had a similar struggle with locking down a venue without certainty of being able to fully book the reservation.</p>\n<p>&#8220;There was what I would consider to be a semi-fanatical obsession with the first weekend in December, which was flatly unavailable at the convention center here,&#8221; said Drew Jaynes, one of the organizers who applied on behalf of Denver.</p>\n<p>&#8220;To give you some perspective, at the time that we applied, March 2016, there were two available weekends left for the Colorado Convention Center &#8211; two in all of 2017. The end of August and the middle of December. To organize an event of this size on what would be considered relatively short notice for a city as popular as Denver was essentially a fool&#8217;s errand.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The Nashville organizing team was able to secure its venue for early December dates, but a wider range of acceptable dates might be one way for WordCamp Central to improve the process for next year. This would give more cities the opportunity to submit competitive applications, as venues that can accommodate the expected size of WCUS are in high demand in popular cities.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We had a great set of communities apply so it was tough to pick just one,&#8221; WordCamp Central representative Cami Kaos said. &#8220;In the end we went with Nashville for WordCamp US 2017-2018 because it seems like a great location for attendees, they had a beautiful venue that could accommodate an event of this size as we grow, and the dynamics between both teams were a natural fit.&#8221;</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re interested in learning more about Nashville, the organizing team has created a <a href=\"http://wpnashville.com/wcus/\" target=\"_blank\">page</a> that includes some favorite local attractions and rankings:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ranked within the top 10 on Cvent ’s list of Top 50 Meeting Destinations in the United States. (August 2015)</li>\n<li>Named #3 Best Convention City in the 10 Best USA Today Readers’ Choice Awards</li>\n<li>Ranked #1 Friendliest City in America by Travel and Leisure (April 2015)</li>\n<li>Listed in Collaborate Magazine’s list of the Top 12 Foodie Cities for Meetings</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Nashville is centrally located for a relatively short drive or flight from anywhere in the US and should have ample options for accommodation. The city won the bid to host the WordCamp out of six applicants and Matt Mullenweg&#8217;s announcement post indicates that there were multiple local communities capable of hosting the event in the future.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Based on the other great applications we got I’m also excited about the pipeline of communities that could host it in future years as WordCamp US travels across the United States and gives us an opportunity to learn and love a new city, as we have with Philadelphia,&#8221; Mullenweg said.</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 16 Nov 2016 21:50:56 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:4;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:55:\"HeroPress: Actually, WordPress didn’t change my life.\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:56:\"https://heropress.com/?post_type=heropress-essays&p=1490\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:66:\"https://heropress.com/essays/actually-wordpress-didnt-change-life/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:9579:\"<img width=\"960\" height=\"480\" src=\"http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/111616-1024x512.jpg\" class=\"attachment-large size-large wp-post-image\" alt=\"Pull Quote: If we serve the people around what we\'re doing, we ourselves will grow, develop & change alongside the people we serve.\" /><p>My story starts in high school as a girl with a technical bent, in a small country town just as computers were becoming mainstream but well before they were in everyone’s home. (I was in high school when Apple came to school and showed off this new fangled thing they called a mouse…). We were taught BASIC and Pascal and I actually really enjoyed tinkering with programming, but no one thought to say, “Dee, you look like you’re good at this, you should pursue it…” I mean, I was a girl (and girls didn’t ‘DO’ computers), and no one in the circles I moved in really had any idea where this technology revolution would take us.</p>\n<p>The truth is I wasn’t particularly ambitious, I didn’t have any kind of clue what I wanted to be ‘when I grew up’ so I allowed myself to be gently steered by my parents into leaving school before the end of my final year when I was encouraged to apply for a job in a bank.</p>\n<p>I got the job and started in the MICR processing department, encoding cheques with magnetic text, and I finished as a teller 3 years later (and boy was I terrible at balancing the books at the end of the day &#8211; I was much better at chatting to the customers!).</p>\n<p>Financial independence was the only name of that game; for me there was very little else to recommend the job, so I saved all the money I could and took off from both the bank, and my homeland (New Zealand) in very short order as a young, naive 20 year old primed to spend the next 3 years exploring the world. And by the world, I mean the US and Europe…</p>\n<p>That first mouse had come out in 1983, WordPress was founded in 2003 and in those 20 years the world changed. While it was doing that I was at various times being a nanny, working in child care centres, working in customer support, temping, and generally &#8216;working to live&#8217; in whatever way felt right at the time. However, in 1999 I packed up my bags once again, moved from New Zealand to Australia and took a place at a performing arts school where I honed my singing and performance skills and volunteered my time to our music director who was starting to experiment with sending out HTML newsletters and updates via email.</p>\n<blockquote><p>And so my personal revolution began.</p></blockquote>\n<p>On what I think was the day after I graduated from that course I walked into a full time role as that music director’s assistant and began my journey back to code. It was part of my job to edit those HTML newsletters and send them out every week. I went from there to buying books about coding for the web, experimenting on my home built PC making web pages. I’m sure like a lot of us, I remember the thrill of creating that first HTML file and seeing a ‘Hello World’ or similar heading rendered in the browser… from there I was completely hooked.</p>\n<p>By 2004 I was working full time as a webmaster, by 2005 I was running a small business creating sites on the side of my ‘real job’ and by 2009 that small business became my full time job as I left employment to pursue my Masters Degree in Digital Communication. It was in that year I met WordPress when I moved my old Movable Type blog onto it and within a very short time I was using  WP as the CMS of choice for all my client work…</p>\n<p>Then in 2011 I stumbled across WordCamps and by extension the WordPress community. THAT was the thing that changed my world.</p>\n<p>I flew on a whim from Sydney to Melbourne to attend this crazy inexpensive conference I had found after a google search for ‘WordPress Conferences’. In doing so I met welcoming people, made friends, connected, and came back to Sydney excited and hopeful about continuing this connection with the wider WP community.</p>\n<p>Building a community around WP got off to a slow start in Sydney, but from an inauspicious early WPSyd meetup in the function room of a pub (one we actually held in the dark due to a blackout) my connection and involvement took off. Before long I was helping organise that Sydney meetup and by the time I moved away from that great city it had branched into 2 meetups, and soon after, into 3. Furthermore at the end of that first year, at my second ever WordCamp, I put my hand up to help organise a WordCamp Sydney in 2012 and then as I moved interstate, WordCamp Melbourne in 2013.</p>\n<p>Here’s the point.</p>\n<p>WordPress, software, technology, the Internet will come and go, morph, and change, evolve. Maybe WordPress will last forever, maybe it will morph into something else, maybe one day it will look completely different than it did when I first started (actually, that’s true now…) the thing that doesn’t change is the humanity around it.</p>\n<blockquote><p>WordPress and any other software package exists to serve people.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The thing that I have learned, not only through WordPress but in life, is that if we too serve the people around what we’re doing, we ourselves will grow, develop and change alongside the people we serve, and the tools we use to serve them.</p>\n<p>In organising meetups, WordCamps, and community events around WordPress,  I have found that at the end of the day it isn’t actually WordPress that matters… it’s those connections, it’s the friendships. It’s the network of work, referrals, support, help, encouragement that has kept me wired into this community and committed to helping other people find that connection and growth for themselves. Even as my career in WP has moved through coding, into team support, into project management, there too it has been the people and my connections to them in the community that have helped fuel that transition.</p>\n<p>I believe that the place I’ve found and the opportunities I have had owe as much to my own desire and ambition as they do to the help, support and belief of the community around me; sometimes even more than I’ve felt in myself. In all of this I feel as though I’m living proof that by helping, connecting, and resourcing other people, I myself have been helped, resourced and connected into places I’d have never dreamed of all those years ago as a teenager playing with that first mouse… experimenting with that BASIC code.</p>\n<p>Arnold Schwarzenegger said “Help others and give something back. I guarantee you will discover that while public service improves the lives and the world around you, its greatest reward is the enrichment and new meaning it will bring your own life.” and I completely agree.</p>\n<p>Ricky Martin said “A hero is someone who is willing to help others in his or her best capacity.” Here are two very different people giving voice to exactly what I’ve found in working and serving in this great community of diverse people. This is the kind of heroism I see around WordPress, at meetups and WordCamps; it’s the kind of hero whom I want to raise up, and at the end of the day, this is the kind of hero I hope that I am.</p>\n<p>Best of all, it’s the kind of hero that absolutely ANY of us can be.</p>\n<div class=\"rtsocial-container rtsocial-container-align-right rtsocial-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-twitter-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-twitter-horizontal-button\"><a title=\"Tweet: Actually, WordPress didn’t change my life.\" class=\"rtsocial-twitter-button\" href=\"https://twitter.com/share?text=Actually%2C%20WordPress%20didn%E2%80%99t%20change%20my%20life.&via=heropress&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Factually-wordpress-didnt-change-life%2F\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-fb-horizontal fb-light\"><div class=\"rtsocial-fb-horizontal-button\"><a title=\"Like: Actually, WordPress didn’t change my life.\" class=\"rtsocial-fb-button rtsocial-fb-like-light\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Factually-wordpress-didnt-change-life%2F\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal-button\"><a class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-button\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Factually-wordpress-didnt-change-life%2F&title=Actually%2C+WordPress+didn%E2%80%99t+change+my+life.\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Share: Actually, WordPress didn’t change my life.\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal-button\"><a class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-button\" href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://heropress.com/essays/actually-wordpress-didnt-change-life/&media=https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/111616-150x150.jpg&description=Actually, WordPress didn’t change my life.\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Pin: Actually, WordPress didn’t change my life.\"></a></div></div><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"perma-link\" href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/actually-wordpress-didnt-change-life/\" title=\"Actually, WordPress didn’t change my life.\"></a></div><p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/actually-wordpress-didnt-change-life/\">Actually, WordPress didn’t change my life.</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com\">HeroPress</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 16 Nov 2016 12:00:21 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8:\"Dee Teal\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:5;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"Dev Blog: WordPress 4.7 Beta 4\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:34:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=4576\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:56:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2016/11/wordpress-4-7-beta-4/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1990:\"<p>WordPress 4.7 Beta 4 is now available!</p>\n<p><strong>This software is still in development,</strong> so we don’t recommend you run it on a production site.

After receiving a series of emails from the provider reminding him that payment was due, the provider terminated his account seven days after the invoice was overdue.</p>\n<p>Lundekvam said ordinarily he would expect his sites and servers to go offline in response to an unpaid invoice but this particular provider, which he would not identify, simply terminated his account.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I contacted the provider in good faith, knowing that any decent provider has complete backups of everything they terminate for X time after they terminate it,&#8221; Lundekvam said. &#8220;Apparently, with this &#8216;crappy&#8217; company, terminated means literally terminated. All decent backup providers have backups of their backups, and any provider with such a setup knows very well that terminating the backups at the same time as you terminate the original files is a HUGE mistake, after all, you have those backups in place just in case something is terminated wrongly or the system corrupts something. We can simply conclude with the fact that this provider didn&#8217;t do backups of their users&#8217; data and therefore would never be able to recover anything they have lost.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Although Lundekvam mentioned Amazon Glacier in a <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/upvato-backup-service-terminated-by-storage-provider-files-may-not-be-recoverable\" target=\"_blank\">previous interview</a> as an example of how cheap storage space is, he confirmed that Amazon was not the provider in question here. &#8220;Amazon was quickly ironed out in the launch phase due to the heavy adjustments it needed to make it work exactly the way we wanted it to,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>Lundekvam said he sincerely believed this backup provider was reliable and was disappointed to find out otherwise after trusting users&#8217; data with the company. Despite the misfortune and embarrassment of the current situation, he is determined to relaunch Upvato with a new provider that offers redundant backups.</p>\n<h3>Upvato to Relaunch with Improved Version that Allows Users to Define Backup Destination</h3>\n<p>Lundekvam said the new version will be launched &#8220;as soon as possible.&#8221; His team is considering firing up the current (old) version and then migrating as originally planned instead of relaunching with the new version. The improvements include a better backup algorithm and new functionality.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The very new version will allow the user to define their own destination / choice of backup location, whether that be on Upvato&#8217;s servers, their own FTP / SFTP server, Dropbox, Amazon, and other providers we&#8217;re looking into implementing,&#8221; Lundekvam said. &#8220;This would make Upvato function as a mere gateway that detects and keeps your backups in sync at your favorite destination, while at the same time presenting the same awesome visual experience on the website to display the sales ad associated with the item.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Lundekvam remains committed to keeping the core service free indefinitely and may add commercial upgrades if costs exceed what he is able to contribute on his own.</p>\n<p>&#8220;As long as I am able to sustain Upvato on my own, then it will remain ad-free and completely free to use,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But of course there are plans to monetize the website if we at some point need help keeping the lights on. That might be ad-generated revenue, or a premium service for premium functionality. But regardless of what we do then, the core functionality of Upvato &#8211; backing up your Envato files &#8211; will always remain free to use.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In response to commenters who suspected the service of fraud and users who may be wary of continuing with the service, Lundekvam said, &#8220;Upvato is not a fraud in any way. It&#8217;s really entirely up to the user if they want to give us a second chance or not. We are a completely free service that intends to do the very best we can do make sure that we stay a reliable, good way to store and backup your Envato files.&#8221;</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 15 Nov 2016 22:48:53 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:8;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:85:\"WPTavern: WordPress 4.7 Improves Accessibility by Removing Alternative Text Fallbacks\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=63819\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:96:\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-4-7-improves-accessibility-by-removing-alternative-text-fallbacks\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1252:\"<p>When images are uploaded in WordPress 4.6.1 that have an empty alt text value, WordPress tries to generate one based on the caption text or the image title. If the image title is non descriptive as is common with photos uploaded from digital cameras, the alt text can be meaningless.</p>\n<p>In WordPress 4.7, the caption text and the image title fallbacks have been removed.

Freddy Lundekvam, a full time programmer and frequent user of Envato products, created the service after losing 10 files to Envato&#8217;s policy of reserving the right to take down and remove any file at its or the author&#8217;s sole discretion. Losing files is a <a href=\"https://forums.envato.com/t/half-of-my-items-removed/27143/3\" target=\"_blank\">common frustration among Envato users</a>, as the company cannot guarantee the ongoing availability of products due to situations like copyright complaints and technical issues.</p>\n<p>Upvato made it easy for users to automatically backup their purchases, cataloguing them with screenshots, descriptions, titles, and author information. The service offered unlimited backups and Lundekvam encouraged users to connect their Envato accounts to keep their files safe. A few weeks ago, Upvato users started to suspect that the service was shutting down.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Anyone using <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Upvato?src=hash\">#Upvato</a> for their themes etc from <a href=\"https://twitter.com/envato\">@envato</a> &#8211; I think you have just been duped!</p>\n<p>&mdash; Andrew Wilkinson (@parysnet) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/parysnet/status/793135773998514176\">October 31, 2016</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">What happened to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/upvato?src=hash\">#upvato</a>?

After experiencing problems with Upvato&#8217;s provider, he is not hopeful that he can recover the files.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Our provider&#8217;s automated systems terminated everything related to Upvato,&#8221; Lundekvam said. &#8220;I am so frustrated and upset that you won&#8217;t believe it, but I am doing what I can do recover the files and or get a backup up and running. But it seems like the provider isn&#8217;t and wasn&#8217;t really a reliable backup provider at all, and as it is right now, it looks really dark for a possible chance to recover the files.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Lundekvam would not specify who his provider was, but had referenced Amazon Glacier in a <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/new-upvato-service-offers-free-backups-for-envato-market-products\" target=\"_blank\">previous interview</a> as an example of cheap storage space at a mere $7/month.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Such things shouldn&#8217;t happen with a backup provider like Upvato, and I am extremely surprised that it happened with our backup provider, causing it to affect Upvato,&#8221; he said. He also confirmed that he does not plan to shut the service down permanently.</p>\n<p>&#8220;If I am unable to recover the backup and files, then no, I am not shutting down,&#8221; Lundekvam said.&#8221; I would, and have to, install Upvato with a new provider and start over. Please rest assured that Upvato is coming back up. Regarding the concerned users, I am deeply sorry for the downtime and, possibly, loss of Envato files. It hurts that it happened, as this is in no way how I want Upvato to be seen or represented.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Lundekvam would not respond to subsequent inquiries. Upvato has had ample time to share this news via other outlets but the service did not have a Twitter account and its website has vanished, leaving users without any information. Lundekvam had said in previous interviews that he did not have plans to monetize Upvato in the immediate future. His motivation was to &#8220;make something cool and useful that people might want and need.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, since he treated Upvato as a side project and did not have further backups in place, an unexpected problem with his provider has wiped out the files users trusted with the service. In an ironic twist, the service has inadvertantly replicated the exact situation that users hoped to avoid with Envato. Lundekvam has not responded to further inquiries on the status of the recovery process, but we will update when any new information is available.</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 14 Nov 2016 21:01:57 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:12;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:34:\"Matt: Flying Lotus, Never Catch Me\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:22:\"https://ma.tt/?p=46928\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:50:\"https://ma.tt/2016/11/flying-lotus-never-catch-me/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:357:\"<p></p>\n<p>Music videos are themselves an art form, and it&#8217;s always interesting to me how an artist chooses to transform the interpretation of their song with the video.

This impacts the SVG loading time, depending on how many emoji you are using, and can even throw warnings on Google&#8217;s <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/\" target=\"_blank\">PageSpeed Insights</a> tool. Turkey-based WordPress developer <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/m_uysl/\" target=\"_blank\">Mustafa Uysal</a> has just released <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/compressed-emoji/\" target=\"_blank\">Compressed Emoji</a>, a plugin that makes use of the <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/hooks/emoji_svg_url/\" target=\"_blank\">emoji_svg_url</a> filter introduced in 4.6. This filter allows developers to change the URL for where emoji SVG images are hosted.</p>\n<p>When the plugin is activated, the compression offers savings in the range of 3kb ~ 1.3kb (roughly %60) per emoji.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/emoji-compressed-comparison.png?ssl=1\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/emoji-compressed-comparison.png?resize=1025%2C511&ssl=1\" alt=\"emoji-compressed-comparison\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-63717\" /></a></p>\n<p>Uysal said he hopes WordPress.org will consider compressing emoji in the future, especially since approximately 10% of the web is using WordPress 4.6. Compressing emoji is a small way to speed up a sizeable chunk of the web. A <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/37374\" target=\"_blank\">ticket</a> was created on Trac four months ago, requesting cache headers for emoji files and compression. According to Gary Pendergast, the change is something that can be made outside of the WordPress core development cycle, so he closed the ticket and <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/systems/2016/07/20/there-are-no-cache-instructions/\" target=\"_blank\">passed the suggestion on to the Systems team</a>. Cache headers were added by the team, but compression was not implemented in that update.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The current plan is to move everything to a new CDN,&#8221; Gary Pendergast reported after chatting with the Systems team. &#8220;The current CDN is a bit outdated &#8211; they don’t support HTTP/2, for example. They need to do some more testing, but it’s high on the todo list.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In the meantime, users who want compressed emoji can use Uysal&#8217;s plugin. It compressed the files using <a href=\"https://github.com/svg/svgo\" target=\"_blank\">SVGO</a>, an open source Node.js-based tool for optimizing SVG vector graphics files. The tool removes unnecessary things like metadata, comments, hidden elements, and default or non-optimal values from the SVG files without affecting their rendering. Another advantage is it doesn&#8217;t require an internet connection for those who are developing locally.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/compressed-emoji/\" target=\"_blank\">Compressed Emoji</a> is available in the WordPress plugin directory and is also open for contributions on <a href=\"https://github.com/mustafauysal/compressed-emoji\" target=\"_blank\">GitHub</a>.</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 11 Nov 2016 23:49:19 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:14;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"Dev Blog: WordPress 4.7 Beta 3\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:34:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=4566\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:56:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2016/11/wordpress-4-7-beta-3/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3091:\"<p>WordPress 4.7 Beta 3 is now available!</p>\n<p><strong>This software is still in development,</strong> so we don’t recommend you run it on a production site.

Baio&#8217;s media and technology blog has been a continual source of original content about life on the internet and how it affects our culture. The migration includes 472 posts and 15,891 entries from his sideblog <a href=\"http://waxy.org/category/links/\" target=\"_blank\">Waxy Links</a>.</p>\n<p>Waxy.org played a small part in WordPress.org&#8217;s early history. In 2005 Baio broke the story about <a href=\"http://waxy.org/2005/03/wordpress_websi/\" target=\"_blank\">WordPress quietly hosting search engine spam articles</a> in order to help cover some of the site&#8217;s expenses. The exposure and subsequent removal of <a href=\"http://random.waxy.org/html/google_wordpress.html\" target=\"_blank\">the articles</a> temporarily decimated WordPress.org&#8217;s pagerank but Matt Mullenweg&#8217;s <a href=\"https://ma.tt/2005/04/a-response/\" target=\"_blank\">response</a> to the situation brought more transparency to how the open source project was being funded. Baio interviewed Mullenweg for the piece and considered it his first foray into serious journalism.</p>\n<p>In his post about the site&#8217;s redesign Baio concedes that blogs are &#8220;not really part of the cultural conversation anymore&#8221; but said he thinks there&#8217;s still potential in the medium.</p>\n<p>&#8220;There a few reasons why I’m sad about the decline of independent blogging, and why I think they’re still worth fighting for,&#8221; Baio said. &#8220;Ultimately, it comes down to two things: ownership and control.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Baio explained why it&#8217;s important for him to control his own space on the web, as opposed to putting content at the mercy of third-party platforms whose futures are not guaranteed:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Last week, Twitter announced they’re shutting down Vine. Twitter, itself, may be acquired and changed in some terrible way. It’s not hard to imagine a post-Verizon Yahoo selling off Tumblr. Medium keeps pivoting, trying to find a successful revenue model. There’s no guarantee any of these platforms will be around in their current state in a year, let alone ten years from now.</p>\n<p>Here, I control my words. Nobody can shut this site down, run annoying ads on it, or sell it to a phone company. Nobody can tell me what I can or can’t say, and I have complete control over the way it’s displayed. Nobody except me can change the URL structure, breaking 14 years of links to content on the web.</p></blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://waxy.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Waxy.org</a> is now responsive and uses a custom theme built using Automattic&#8217;s <a href=\"http://components.underscores.me/\" target=\"_blank\">Components starter-theme generator</a>. Baio will continue exploring odd corners of the internet on his blog and plans to share his thoughts about the challenges of navigating the ecosystem of independent publishers.</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 10 Nov 2016 23:45:20 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:16;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:57:\"WPTavern: bbPress 2.5.11 Adds WordPress 4.7 Compatibility\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=63694\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:68:\"https://wptavern.com/bbpress-2-5-11-adds-wordpress-4-7-compatibility\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2494:\"<p>The bbPress development team has <a href=\"https://bbpress.org/blog/2016/11/bbpress-2-5-11-maintenance-release/\">released 2.5.11</a> to add support <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2016/11/07/changed-loading-order-for-current-user-in-4-7/\">for a technical change</a> in WordPress 4.7. Users are highly encouraged to update to bbPress 2.5.11 <strong>before</strong> updating to WordPress 4.7. In 4.7, the loading order for the current user in the function stack was changed to accommodate <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2016/11/07/user-admin-languages-and-locale-switching-in-4-7/\">user locale switching</a>.</p>\n<p>Previously, BuddyPress and bbPress displayed a custom notice when a user was initialized without using WP-&gt;init(). In addition to patching the issue in <a href=\"https://buddypress.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/7305\">BuddyPress</a> and <a href=\"https://bbpress.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/2309\">bbPress</a>, a new <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/23016\">wp_roles_init filter</a> was added to WordPress that allows plugins to add custom roles when they&#8217;re initialized.</p>\n<p>The changes mentioned above are technical in nature so I asked John James Jacoby, lead developer of bbPress, what the update really means. &#8220;bbPress loads its roles on-the-fly, in a similar way to how post-types and taxonomies are registered,&#8221; Jacoby told the Tavern.</p>\n<p>&#8220;With locales and roles now having a reversed load order, bbPress needed some code changes to work for both WordPress 4.6 and 4.7 without causing any problems for third-party bbPress plugins and non-English installations.&#8221;</p>\n<p>This particular improvement has personal historical meaning to Jacoby, &#8220;This change to WordPress core in 4.7 is a long time coming,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It was the very first bug I ever reported in WordPress&#8217; IRC channel back in 2008, when I was working on a large multi-lingual multisite installation. It&#8217;s how I met Peter Westwood and Jen Mylo, and it was their kindness that made it clear that WordPress was the platform for me.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Jacoby also notes that per-forum moderators, favorites, and subscriptions have been rewritten in bbPress 2.6. During testing, performance enhancements were discovered and submitted to WordPress core and have been implemented across the forums on WordPress.org. Work continues on bbPress 2.6 which is expected to ship in 2017.</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 10 Nov 2016 22:33:44 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:17;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:81:\"WPTavern: WPWeekly Episode 253 – BuddyPress 2.8, WordCamp US, and PressNomics 5\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:58:\"https://wptavern.com?p=63684&preview=true&preview_id=63684\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:86:\"https://wptavern.com/wpweekly-episode-253-buddypress-2-8-wordcamp-us-and-pressnomics-5\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3135:\"<p>In this episode of WordPress Weekly, <a href=\"http://marcuscouch.com/\">Marcus Couch</a> and I discuss the news of the week.

This will be the first time the event has been held outside of the United States, a change that makes it more accessible for contributors who are unable to obtain a visa to enter the U.S.</p>\n<p>Attaching the summit to WordCamp Europe was the next logical step, as the event brings together project contributors from around the world. Europe is one of the fastest growing regions for the WordPress community in terms of events, with a <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/europe-tops-wordcamp-growth-in-2015-with-70-increase-in-events\" target=\"_blank\">70% increase in WordCamps in 2015</a>. There were 20 WordCamps held in October and 50% of those were hosted in European cities.</p>\n<p>The past three community summits have been invitation-only in order to ensure those present were active contributors to WordPress and to enable a format that facilitates face-to-face discussions on key issues facing the project and the community. This inevitably leaves many valuable contributors on the outside. In an effort to mitigate the sense of exclusivity around the event, the WordPress Community Team is <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/2016/11/03/wordpress-community-summit-2017/\" target=\"_blank\">proposing a new selection process for 2017</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>If we have to limit our attendance to have productive, collaborative discussions at the Summit, then choosing the participants becomes a challenge if we don’t know what the teams are going to discuss ahead of time. Therefore, this year I suggest we try something new:</p>\n<p>Let’s ask teams to decide on the challenging, controversial, or sensitive issues they want to discuss at the summit before the summit is held. Then, once the teams know what they want to talk over in person, they can nominate and select the people needed to represent all points of view in each of those discussions. This way, the event stays small, hard topics get discussed, but the selection process is more transparent and functional.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Rocio Valdivia, who posted the proposal on behalf of the team, roughly outlined how the selection process would work. She suggested each make.wordpress.org project team would create and publish a list of topics/issues for discussion at the summit and submit them by December 20th. Teams would then select representatives to attend the summit. Two members of those selected would be assigned to help with the organization and logistics of the summit, including tasks such as finding sponsors, travel assistance, and communication.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The intention of this approach is to propose a more open and team-focus Community Summit with transparent participation from all active contributors and reps of each team,&#8221; Valdivia said. &#8220;This way we can hopefully anticipate barriers and cross-team difficulties that might come up, and avoid them.&#8221;</p>\n<p>This approach is different from past events where attendees were not part of the organizational aspects but it gives contributors more ownership of the event and their teams&#8217; specific goals. Details and logistics would be worked out later in the year with the help of the WCEU organizers.</p>\n<p>The Community Team is asking for feedback on the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/2016/11/03/wordpress-community-summit-2017/\" target=\"_blank\">proposal</a> before implementing a plan of action for the new selection process. As the open source project has grown, WordPress has hundreds of contributors spread across its three dozen core <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/components/\" target=\"_blank\">components</a>. So far contributors have weighed in on the initial proposed number of team representatives and the deadline for preparing topics.</p>\n<p>There was also some concern in the Community Team&#8217;s meeting on Slack as to whether the new selection process will perpetuate the pattern of the same people being invited to the summit every time simply because they are most active in the project. Allowing teams to nominate their representatives based on the anticipated topics will make the selection process more focused on which contributors are best suited to work on pressing issues. Moving the location to Europe will also give regional contributors the opportunity to bring fresh ideas and perspectives, especially regarding the challenges of multilingual publishing with WordPress.</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 10 Nov 2016 06:48:23 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:19;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:103:\"WPTavern: A New Way to Search, Preview, and Install Themes in the Customizer Removed From WordPress 4.7\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=63634\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:112:\"https://wptavern.com/a-new-way-to-search-preview-and-install-themes-in-the-customizer-removed-from-wordpress-4-7\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4376:\"<p>Astute testers may have noticed a new feature in WordPress 4.7 beta 1 that enabled users to search, preview, and install themes from within the customizer.

Confession? It feels like it sometimes. In my mind’s eye I see a roomful of skittish WordPress marketers with dark-ringed eyes, disclosing the number of times they pretended to understand something technical when it made about as much sense to them as the moon landing. Frustrated they can’t code it themselves. Maybe it’s just me in that room.</p>\n<p>I am a words person – a creative, a copywriter, and a marketer. My heart beats faster over ancient English literature, clever mailers, alliteration, storytelling and subject lines, and the shapeshifting challenge of building an authentic brand in a world of smoke, mirrors, and shmoozing.</p>\n<p>Topher asked me to write my WordPress story and when I thought about what I’ve learnt over the past two years what came to mind was: <strong>uncomfortable doesn’t mean walk away</strong>.</p>\n<p>Far from being something to categorically flee or avoid, discomfort is a signpost to watch out for – something to embrace and step bravely towards. Obviously there are exceptions – but in my experience discomfort often means lean in, listen closely, change something.</p>\n<p>I’ve chosen to share a few of the ways I’ve encountered uncomfortable in my WordPress journey so far, and why I’m grateful.</p>\n<h3>A bit of background</h3>\n<p>Perhaps we are all creatures of habit on some level, but I really am. For example, when backpacking with my best friend in 2008 from Istanbul down to Cairo – through Syria and Jordan, including places that are now literally non-existent – she and I noticed that if we found a good restaurant I’d suggest returning the following night while she always wanted to try new spots.</p>\n<p>When I find something I like, it makes perfect sense to me to stick with it, sometimes to a fault. Until fairly recently I would have described myself as someone who didn’t thrive on change. This partly explains why by the age of twenty nine my entire life had played out in one city.</p>\n<a href=\"http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/IMG_5951-min.jpg\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-1470\" src=\"http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/IMG_5951-min-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"Marina as a child with mother\" width=\"960\" height=\"720\" /></a>My beautiful mum, brother and I. My mum is a superhuman and I miss her daily.\n<p>Birth, preschool to postgraduate studies, the first nine years of my career, family, friends, life – all in one patch.</p>\n<p>I have been privileged to do some excellent travelling to amazing places – European beach holidays and ski trips (obviously I broke my arm), teaching English for four weeks in South Korea, a cruise in Alaska, a church trip to Singapore and Malaysia, Vancouver to visit family – but my sense of home and place was unwaveringly Cape Town.</p>\n<p>At the beginning of 2014 I decided to emigrate. The delay between the idea occurring to me and resigning was less than two weeks. With a British passport through my English mum and a mild obsession with all things British, London was it. It seemed wise to secure a job first but my gut said I should have faith and move regardless so I resigned from Yuppiechef.com <a href=\"https://www.yuppiechef.com/spatula/10-thoughts-about-community-management-and-social-media/\">where I’d been for nearly five years</a>, sold my car, and booked a one way ticket.</p>\n<p>At this point, it would be fair to say WordPress was not even really on my radar. It powered Yuppiechef’s blog so I’d used it in that capacity and <a href=\"https://marinapape.com/\">my own blog</a> was on WordPress.com – but it was pretty much just a thing to do with the internet that helped people publish stuff.</p>\n<p>A week before I set off I was having sushi with friends and got chatting to a mouthy American who worked for WooThemes. Hearing of my pending departure and getting a sense of my strengths and what I loved to do, he suggested I consider applying. Less than a week later I accepted an offer to join Woo’s then-tiny marketing team. I’m still amazed at the speed with which it all happened – and will be forever amused by Mark and Warren’s confidence in me as a total WordPress n0ob (maybe they didn’t realise!).</p>\n<a href=\"http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/IMG_8001-min.jpg\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-1471\" src=\"http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/IMG_8001-min-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"I love MailChimp.

Freddy lives on my desk beside some Woo stickers\n<p>And so my WordPress journey began in London on 1 July 2014, fresh off the boat and working remotely for the first time. I logged online from a coffee shop – specifically Timberyard, which has become a familiar friend – and dived headfirst into a world I hadn’t realised would be so technical. And digital. Marketing a digital product is a very different kettle of fish to kitchen products. And working remotely as an extrovert?</p>\n<p>In my first week I was sent to WordCamp Brighton where I innocently asked someone the difference between .org and WordPress.com. This was the first prickle of my first uncomfortable hurdle: being okay with not knowing everything.</p>\n<h3>It really is okay not to know everything.</h3>\n<p>It sounds stupid to even write that one needs to be okay with not knowing everything – of course one can’t, but at Yuppiechef.com I sure knew a lot more about a lot more. There, my lack of technical understanding wasn’t a thing, marketing was lauded, and our brand was at the forefront of what set us apart. <a href=\"http://ventureburn.com/2013/03/the-yuppiechef-cult-how-a-startup-sparked-a-religion/\">People wrote about how the following for Yuppiechef was cult-like</a>, and I’d helped create that.</p>\n<p>Joining Woo I was a tiny fish all over again, and I was swimming in a world with languages I didn’t understand.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Everyone is a genius. But if you judge a fish by its ability to climb a tree, it will live its whole life believing that it is stupid. – unknown (but attributed to Einstein)</p></blockquote>\n<p>It was a little bit terrifying to be a marketer in this tech-celebratory world. And it took me a long time to accept I have something significant to offer at WooCommerce (and now Automattic) and feel confident enough to add my voice to conversations. Why? I guess I am proud. In the early days I was constantly tempted to pretend to know more than I do (for the record this is a bad idea) and developed a hefty dose of imposter syndrome, which worsened when Automattic acquired WooCommerce. I found myself wondering if they would have hired me.</p>\n<p>For a few months, the fear I felt kept me from bringing to the table the valuable things I did know.</p>\n<a href=\"http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/IMG_7373-min.jpg\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-1472\" src=\"http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/IMG_7373-min-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"Standing by a concrete wall with a vast ocean scene behind.\" width=\"960\" height=\"720\" /></a>With my team in Cape Town earlier this year. Nicole, Aviva, me, Gareth and Kevin &lt;3.\n<p>It’s scary admitting a lack of understanding, it takes strong relationships with colleagues (which take time to build, especially remotely) to raise your hand and be vulnerable. But the problem is that not doing so ends up blocking and robbing the contribution you could make. It silences your voice. It is not possible to be a master of all trades: yes I need a working understanding of our products, but I don’t need to become a Javascript developer. One body, many parts, all valuable.</p>\n<p>This learning curve was uncomfortable for me. At various points I have wanted to bail, or take a year to learn how to code fulltime. But I am really glad I haven’t because marketing is vital and that is what I can do. And do very well (when I’m not looking over my shoulder).</p>\n<p>It’s okay to be an expert in what you love, not what other people love. It’s why we have teams. It’s what makes the world interesting.</p>\n<a href=\"http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/IMG_3576-min.jpg\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-1473\" src=\"http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/IMG_3576-min-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"Classroom filled with people\" width=\"960\" height=\"720\" /></a>The first WordPress London meetup I attended. It was pretty awesome.\n<h3>Remote relationships take longer to build but they sure run deep.</h3>\n<p>My degree was in Psychology and it remains an active interest. ENFJ is proudly in my Twitter bio, I love taking personality tests and calling out and connecting with the underbellies and depths of fellow human beings.</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;<strong>My friends are my estate</strong>. Forgive me then the avarice to hoard them.&#8221; – Emily Dickinson</p></blockquote>\n<p>If you’re familiar with Gallups Strengthfinder, I’m a Relator to the bone. People often ask how I have the discipline to work from home but that’s pocket change compared to the relational challenge. Showing up to work and being productive hasn’t been the thing I’ve found difficult – it’s trying to build relationship digitally with people far away and in different timezones.</p>\n<p>Plus I find there is a certain type of rapport, creativity, and energy that is really hard to create remotely when it comes to brainstorming and collaborating. The buzz of having an idea and someone else adding to it IRL, growing it into something greater. This was not a comfortable thing, but again choosing to stay has proven invaluable.</p>\n<p><strong>Remote relationships take longer to build, but they sure run deep</strong>. The bonding that happens when you come together for meetups and WordCamps is extraordinary. I have grown to properly know and love my colleagues (not all 500+ Automatticians yet but certainly my immediate team) and a bunch of awesome WordPress people I’ve met.</p>\n<a href=\"http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/IMG_8319-min.jpg\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-1474\" src=\"http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/IMG_8319-min-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"On-screen grid of faces in a google hangout\" width=\"960\" height=\"720\" /></a>Well hello Woo people.

It’s fragmenting, but what a privilege.</p>\n<p>To keep me grounded day to day, I’ve helped start and now am involved in running a non-profit coworking space, which has opened up a whole new web of relationships in London.

Being part of WordPress has brought me into close proximity with a more varied, vocal, challenging, and diverse group than I could have made up.</p>\n<p>The thing about being a human is you only ever get to be one of them. One in over seven billion. How much about other people and parts of the world you don’t live in do you know, really? How much do I? Being part of WordPress has opened my eyes to diversity in a way that is hard to describe. Emigrating helped too, but it is very possible to live in a bubble wherever you go.</p>\n<blockquote><p>A long habit of not thinking a thing wrong gives it a superficial appearance of being right. – Thomas Paine</p></blockquote>\n<p>Just because something has always been a certain way, doesn’t make it right. Being part of WordPress, and Automattic, has helped me greatly in learning how to hold what I believe to be right and true gently, and have equal respect for other people’s right and true.</p>\n<p>I ran the WooCommerce London meetup for two years which brought me into contact with a very mixed group; I was part of Automattic’s diversity workshop at the GM which was educational to say the least; when my friend Rosie started a <a href=\"http://mouthywomen.work/\">blog</a> to highlight out how mouthy women get told they’re too masculine, I got behind her heart and soul.</p>\n<a href=\"http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Screen-Shot-2016-11-03-at-13.21.46-min.png\"><img class=\"wp-image-1476 size-full\" src=\"http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Screen-Shot-2016-11-03-at-13.21.46-min.png\" alt=\"Stewart Ritchie sharing at the WooCommerce London meetup.

Photo: Gabor Javorsky.\n<p>The most poignant example of this for me was much closer to home. I wrote some copy a while ago as the backstory of Woo’s ninja mascot, Hiro and included in it a bunch of references to Japanese culture that, though well intentioned, turned out to be not okay. It had been up for ages before someone with a different enough perspective flagged it. Ouch.</p>\n<p>I went home after a long day of tears and much Slack messaging and confided in my Malaysian flatmate about it, half expecting him to comfort me and say the whole thing really wasn’t such a big deal and that it didn’t bother him. Instead his only comment was: “<em>That’s good. It will make your company better.</em>”</p>\n<p>We live, we learn. We wound, we grow.</p>\n<p>John Maeda, who recently joined Automattic as Head of Design and Inclusion, calls such oversights in our thinking ‘lacunae’. Being part of the worldwide community of WordPress has brought a number of my own lacunae into sharp focus. It’s also made me more able to exist peacefully alongside people whose views I don’t share. I’m a human, they’re a human. Two in seven billion.</p>\n<p>Now, the idea of stepping away and retreating to a more homogenous, same-y group of people who tend to agree with me is not just unattractive, it’s scary.</p>\n<p>WordPress helps me be open-minded and it’s vehicle for doing this is individuals who are willing to speak up. Let’s help each other, as kindly and graciously as we can.</p>\n<h3>Marketing a WordPress product is difficult.</h3>\n<p>I’ve found marketing WooCommerce challenging for two reasons.</p>\n<p>First there is the classic digital marketer’s problem of how to build relationship with customers you never get to meet. All we have are words online and if we’re lucky some rituals and routines we can inject life into (I wrote about this strategy <a href=\"https://woocommerce.com/2015/11/4-customer-rituals/\">here</a>).</p>\n<p>Over the past two years there have been a number of times I have thrown my hands up in the air and wanted to market something that is just easier to sell (coffee, an awesome gadget, luxury jewelry).</p>\n<p>On top of that eCommerce is a competitive space and selling WordPress can be a little complex messaging-wise, especially for non-coders and those not familiar with WordPress:</p>\n<p><em>Friend: Do I even have WooCommerce yet?</em><br />\n<em> Me: Yes it’s there in your downloads folder.</em><br />\n<em> Friend: <span>&lt;silence&gt;</span>.</em></p>\n<p>Every time I see another seductive Squarespace ad or the daily Shopify case study lands in my inbox (<em>How person x built y and changed the destiny of the human race</em>) – part of me can only see how far we have to go.</p>\n<p>But, I am enjoying fighting the good fight to democratise eCommerce with WordPress. I believe in what we’re doing, and in open source, and even though our competitors have bigger marketing teams and 24/7 phone support I feel a fierce loyalty to Woo.</p>\n<p>I don’t believe marketing has the emphasis it deserves in the WordPress space, but it’s coming to the fore. Great products don’t market themselves. The weaker thing will win if that is what is in front of people. I’m excited to be in this space.</p>\n<h3>Saying less is more. Narrow focus is healthy.</h3>\n<p>As someone who loves to joke around, natter, and come up with ideas, something I have learnt the hard way is that volume of words and number of ideas is not no an indicator of the quality of your contribution.</p>\n<p>It feels nice to be busy, but what is the deliverable?</p>\n<p>Having another great idea is not always helpful. Sometimes what I need to do is shut up and work. The manager versus maker ratio tends to leave a lot of cooks in the kitchen. Ideas are a dime a dozen. Pushing a few strategic things over the line, with your eyes on a goal everyone has agreed on, now that’s a better way.</p>\n<p>Staying focused working remotely can be hard. Fortunately, we have a great system of setting OKRs that my team is particularly diligent at sticking to. There are so. Many. Conversations. Going on all of the time. Focus is a healthy and freeing thing.</p>\n<a href=\"http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/IMG_4139-min.jpg\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-1477\" src=\"http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/IMG_4139-min-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"Marina and Louise, heads together, grinning\" width=\"960\" height=\"720\" /></a>My Woo bestie, Louise. Here we are in San Francisco in 2014. I went back to South Africa for her wedding this year :).\n<h3>Inclusion is a very important thing.</h3>\n<p>A final thing I am learning through WordPress, and which has made my uncomfortable for sure, is the importance of inclusion. I touched on this a little already, but it’s something that I have now got my teeth into and am not going to let go of. Inclusion is a thing.</p>\n<p>Something that is great about WordPress is that intrinsically inclusive, it’s open to all.</p>\n<p>It isn’t only about big shiny success stories where people are making thousands of dollars. It’s people all over the world, fighting to make WordPress available in all languages; it’s faithful meetup organisers sharing knowledge with those who are just starting out; it’s the GPL; it’s having childcare at WordCamps; it’s using <em>y’all</em> or <em>folks</em> not <em>guys</em> to greet an audience.</p>\n<p>WordPress is not slick, sometimes things get a bit messy and there are heated discussions on forums and in backchannels. But WordPress is also a lot like how the world should be – democratic, going out of it’s way to make room and include, and with more than just the bottom line driving decisions.</p>\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\n<p>That’s it from me. I hope sharing just a few of the ways WordPress has made me uncomfortable– what I learnt, and why I am glad I didn’t just bail – will be encouraging.</p>\n<p>Perhaps you are facing some tough things related to work or beyond. Maybe someone has expressed an opinion or belief that has made you uncomfortable. I’d encourage you to pause and take some time to think over whatever it is before acting.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Uncomfortable often means there is something amazing to be learnt.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Let’s be brave, open, and keep on learning together through this wonderful thing called WordPress.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/IMG_4832-min.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-1478\" src=\"http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/IMG_4832-min-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"Pin board with hundreds of photos all over it.\" width=\"960\" height=\"720\" /></a></p>\n<div class=\"rtsocial-container rtsocial-container-align-right rtsocial-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-twitter-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-twitter-horizontal-button\"><a title=\"Tweet: Uncomfortable doesn’t mean walk away\" class=\"rtsocial-twitter-button\" href=\"https://twitter.com/share?text=Uncomfortable%20doesn%E2%80%99t%20mean%20walk%20away&via=heropress&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Funcomfortable-doesnt-mean-walk-away%2F\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-fb-horizontal fb-light\"><div class=\"rtsocial-fb-horizontal-button\"><a title=\"Like: Uncomfortable doesn’t mean walk away\" class=\"rtsocial-fb-button rtsocial-fb-like-light\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Funcomfortable-doesnt-mean-walk-away%2F\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal-button\"><a class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-button\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Funcomfortable-doesnt-mean-walk-away%2F&title=Uncomfortable+doesn%E2%80%99t+mean+walk+away\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Share: Uncomfortable doesn’t mean walk away\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal-button\"><a class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-button\" href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://heropress.com/essays/uncomfortable-doesnt-mean-walk-away/&media=https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/110916-150x150.jpg&description=Uncomfortable doesn’t mean walk away\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Pin: Uncomfortable doesn’t mean walk away\"></a></div></div><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"perma-link\" href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/uncomfortable-doesnt-mean-walk-away/\" title=\"Uncomfortable doesn’t mean walk away\"></a></div><p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/uncomfortable-doesnt-mean-walk-away/\">Uncomfortable doesn’t mean walk away</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com\">HeroPress</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 09 Nov 2016 12:00:54 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:11:\"Marina Pape\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:21;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:83:\"WPTavern: BuddyPress 2.8 Development Kicks Off, 2016 Survey Now Open for Developers\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=63402\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:93:\"https://wptavern.com/buddypress-2-8-development-kicks-off-2016-survey-now-open-for-developers\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3278:\"<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/buddypress-logo-blue.png?ssl=1\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/buddypress-logo-blue.png?resize=839%2C398&ssl=1\" alt=\"buddypress-logo-blue\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-30655\" /></a></p>\n<p>Development for BuddyPress 2.8 kicked off during <a href=\"https://bpdevel.wordpress.com/2016/11/05/dev-chat-summary-for-november-2-2016/\" target=\"_blank\">last week&#8217;s meeting</a> and the target release date was set for January 25. In line with the project&#8217;s <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/buddypress-2-7-development-kicks-off-project-shifts-focus-to-developers-and-site-builders\" target=\"_blank\">recent change of course</a>, the upcoming release will be another one focused on developers and site builders.</p>\n<p>Long time contributor <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/slaFFik\" target=\"_blank\">Slava Abakumov</a> is leading 2.8 with a focus on reducing the 650+ tickets in BuddyPress Trac by 50%. He will coordinate contributors in working on a UI for developer features that were added in the 2.6 and 2.7 releases, which introduced an API for Group Types. Abakumov wants to dive deeper into security and plans to perform a security audit of the plugin.</p>\n<p>The BuddyPress core team will shape development for 2017 based on feedback from this year&#8217;s <a href=\"https://buddypress.org/2016/11/2016-buddypress-survey-site-builders-developers/\" target=\"_blank\">survey</a>, which opened November 1. It includes 36 questions aimed at site builders and developers, as opposed to previous years where the survey was <a href=\"https://buddypress.org/2014/01/2014-buddypress-survey/\" target=\"_blank\">open to users and anyone connected with the software</a>.</p>\n<p>The project&#8217;s change of direction is evident in the questions this year, which are decidedly developer-focused. According to the BuddyPress core team, these questions were prepared for the project&#8217;s primary audience of site builders and developers, &#8220;an explicit recognition of what BuddyPress has become, and how people use it.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In addition to the usual demographical questions, respondents are asked about their PHP versions, site setups, and local development environments. A new question asks when developers test their sites and extensions against upcoming releases. The survey also asks which template files developers customize when creating themes (with no option to indicate that you&#8217;re not a theme developer). Participants are asked to weigh in on BuddyPress&#8217; problem areas and to give feedback on the most frequent feature requests they receive from community members and clients.</p>\n<p>In 2013 the survey received 178 responses, 338 responses in 2014, and 211 in 2015. Given that the target audience is much narrower in 2016, the number of participants may decline again. However, the core team hopes responses will be more concentrated with the kind of information they find useful. The <a href=\"https://buddypress.org/2016/11/2016-buddypress-survey-site-builders-developers/\" target=\"_blank\">survey</a> will be open through November 20, 2016 and results will be posted before the end of the year.</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 08 Nov 2016 18:17:40 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:22;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:55:\"WPTavern: WordCamp US Live Stream Tickets Now Available\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=63030\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:66:\"https://wptavern.com/wordcamp-us-live-stream-tickets-now-available\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2838:\"<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/wordcamp-us.png?ssl=1\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/wordcamp-us.png?resize=1025%2C490&ssl=1\" alt=\"wordcamp-us\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-59619\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://2016.us.wordcamp.org\" target=\"_blank\">WordCamp US</a> is less than a month away and attendees are finalizing their travel plans. In August, organizers were <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordcamp-us-calls-for-volunteers-organizers-estimate-3000-attendees\" target=\"_blank\">estimating 3,000 attendees</a> on the ground but official numbers are not yet available as tickets continue to sell. A maximum capacity has not been published, because organizers have a great deal of flexibility to expand the event to thousands more if necessary.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The entire side of the PA Convention Center is ours, and we’re not using all of the spaces that they have,&#8221; WordCamp US co-organizer Alx Block said. &#8220;The sky is the limit.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Last week a world-class lineup of <a href=\"https://2016.us.wordcamp.org/speakers/\" target=\"_blank\">speakers</a> was confirmed from a record number of applicants. The team received 600 submissions (up from 231 last year) and accepted less than 10% of them, according to Block.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I think that WCUS last year really excited a lot of people, and they were interested in being a part of it,&#8221; Block said. &#8220;We also had quite a bit more time on the speaker applications, since in 2015 we planned the entire conference in just about three months.&#8221;</p>\n<p>One exciting change this year is that <a href=\"https://2016.us.wordcamp.org/2016/11/02/wordcamp-us-live-stream/\" target=\"_blank\">live stream tickets</a> will be free for those who are not able to attend the event. There&#8217;s no limit on the number of people who can watch live.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We really felt like there shouldn’t be a barrier to entry in attending WCUS,&#8221; Block said. &#8220;It’s the community’s conference, and everyone should be able to &#8216;attend&#8217; no matter where they physically are. We have some incredible sponsors, and making the live stream free felt like the best move.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Last year&#8217;s live stream tickets included swag from the event, and WCUS 2016 will have commemorative t-shirts for sale in the swag store. In addition to the live stream, all of the sessions will be recorded and uploaded to WordPress.tv. If you are joining by live stream, make sure to <a href=\"https://2016.us.wordcamp.org/tickets/\" target=\"_blank\">reserve your ticket</a> in advance. You can also <a href=\"https://2016.us.wordcamp.org/live-stream/attendee-test/\" target=\"_blank\">test your computer for compatibility</a> ahead of the event.</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 07 Nov 2016 21:47:35 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:23;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:45:\"WPTavern: Take the 2016 WordPress User Survey\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=63524\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:56:\"https://wptavern.com/take-the-2016-wordpress-user-survey\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1483:\"<p>With <a href=\"https://2016.us.wordcamp.org/\">WordCamp US</a> a little less than a month away, it&#8217;s time to take the <a href=\"https://wordpressdotorg.polldaddy.com/s/wordpress-2016-survey\">2016 WordPress user survey</a>.

This transparent and open process of updating the guidelines resulted in more than a dozen contributors submitting pull requests with improvements to the language and content. The <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-org/detailed-plugin-guidelines/\" target=\"_blank\">revamped guidelines</a> have now replaced the previous ones with language and expectations that are clearer and easier to understand.</p>\n<p>&#8220;In addition to rewriting the guidelines, we took the time to codify the expectations of developers and cost of not abiding by the guidelines, as well as a reminder that we do remove plugins for security issues,&#8221; plugin team member Mika Epstein said in the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/plugins/2016/11/01/revised-guidelines-are-live/\" target=\"_blank\">announcement</a>. &#8220;We are doing our best to be transparent of what we expect from you and, in return, what you can expect from us.&#8221;</p>\n<p>After several incidents this year where unclear guidelines contributed to confusion on issues like <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-plugin-directory-cracks-down-on-incentivized-reviews-despite-lack-of-official-guideline\" target=\"_blank\">incentivized reviews</a> and <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/the-wordpress-plugin-directory-will-no-longer-accept-frameworks\" target=\"_blank\">developers submitting frameworks</a>, the plugin team made the jump to update the five-year-old document. Although there are not major changes, some of the guidelines were considerably expanded for clarity. This includes #9: &#8220;The plugin and its developers must not do anything illegal, dishonest, or morally offensive.&#8221; The list was updated with several more examples of infractions that would land under this category.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It’s a massive undertaking to re-write guidelines in the public eye in a way that won’t pull the rug out from anyone,&#8221; Epstein said. &#8220;Our goal was to clarify, not totally change, but also to address the needs of an ever changing technology.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Because the plugin directory was created to serve the WordPress project and its users, it doesn&#8217;t function like many other popular directories and marketplaces. Clear language and expectations are important, especially with WordPress&#8217; growing international user base. The newly updated guidelines should cut down on incidents where the plugin team has to enforce guidelines that were not explicitly documented.</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 07 Nov 2016 06:03:59 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:27;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"BuddyPress: BuddyPress 2.7.2\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:32:\"https://buddypress.org/?p=260750\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:48:\"https://buddypress.org/2016/11/buddypress-2-7-2/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:888:\"<p>BuddyPress 2.7.2 is now available.

The social activities will be available as a separate purchase of $50 when buying your tickets. To take full advantage of the event, organizers suggest that attendees fly in on Wednesday, April 5th and leave on Sunday, April 9th.</p>\n<p>Tickets have yet to go on sale and the speaker lineup is in the process of being finalized.

One of the feature projects is the custom <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2016/10/11/feature-proposal-better-theme-customizations-via-custom-css-with-live-previews/\">CSS editor</a> that enables users to <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/the-days-of-creating-child-themes-for-simple-css-changes-may-soon-be-over\">make CSS changes to a theme</a> without having to create a <a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/Child_Themes\">child theme</a>.</p>\n<a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/WP47CustomizerCSSEditor.png?ssl=1\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-63483\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/WP47CustomizerCSSEditor.png?resize=1025%2C394&ssl=1\" alt=\"CSS Editor in The WordPress 4.7 Customizer\" /></a>CSS Editor in The WordPress 4.7 Customizer\n<p>In WordPress 4.7, there&#8217;s a new section in the customizer labeled Additional CSS. Clicking the label displays a blank pane with a short description of what users can do. Clicking the help icon displays a short explanation of what CSS is with a link to a <a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/Know_Your_Sources#CSS\">help document</a> on the Codex. The Additional CSS pane is more like a text area than an editor.</p>\n<p>Unlike Jetpack&#8217;s Edit CSS module, the editor in the customizer lacks line numbers, colored text, and other conveniences. However, these are features that are likely to be added in future iterations.</p>\n<a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/JetpacksEditCSSModule.png?ssl=1\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-63484\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/JetpacksEditCSSModule.png?resize=601%2C423&ssl=1\" alt=\"Jetpack\'s Edit CSS Module\" /></a>Jetpack&#8217;s Edit CSS Module\n<p>There are a couple of things to keep in mind before using Additional CSS. First, it does not have revision support enabled. Weston Ruter, WordPress core committer, <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/35395#comment:76\">says</a> revision support is disabled by default and requires a plugin.</p>\n<p>Second, changes are theme specific and are not global. Luke Cavanagh <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/35395#comment:83\">has inquired</a> on whether an option will be added in the future to enable global CSS changes which could come in handy for making tweaks for active plugins.</p>\n<p>During testing, I didn&#8217;t encounter any issues with writing or pasting CSS code into the Additional CSS area. I encourage you to download and install <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2016/10/wordpress-4-7-beta-1/\">WordPress 4.7 beta 1</a> and try it out for yourself and let us know your thoughts.

Gordon <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/zac-gordon-to-kickstart-javascript-master-course-for-wordpress\">created the course</a> after <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/treehouse-drops-support-for-wordpress-education\">Treehouse dropped WordPress</a> from its library in late 2015.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://javascriptforwp.com/#enroll\">Open enrollment</a> began on October 25th and ends this Friday, November 4th. You can either take all four parts of the course for $397 or a single part for $199. The next open enrollment period will be in 2017.</p>\n<h2>A Four Part Course</h2>\n<p>The first part of the <a href=\"https://javascriptforwp.com/course-outline/\">course covers</a> basic and advanced JavaScript skills and development tools. Students will also learn how to create a single page web application built with JavaScript called VanillaPress.</p>\n<p>The second part of the course is dedicated to JavaScript libraries and frameworks where students will learn how to build a decoupled web application called ReactPress using React and the WordPress REST API.</p>\n<p>The third part covers the WordPress REST API. Using OAuth, students will add OAuth support for ReactPress and add Save and Edit abilities to the app via the API.</p>\n<p>The fourth and final part of the course is devoted to real world projects. Students will learn how to build single page plugins, mobile apps, and JavaScript powered themes that use the REST API.</p>\n<p>The course is geared towards those who want to &#8220;Learn JavaScript, deeply,&#8221; a task <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/state-of-the-word-2015-javascript-and-api-driven-interfaces-are-the-future-of-wordpress\">assigned to the WordPress community</a> by Matt Mullenweg in his 2015 State of the Word presentation.

To do that, I discovered the power of self-reflection and began a journey to understand the very core of who I am. I’m not a hero, but I know when to be one. When fear and worry appears I recognize it. And then I conquer it.</p>\n<p>If you don’t think you are good enough or smart enough to be and have what you want in life, then fear is holding you back, too. The story that follows is both inspired by and written for you.</p>\n<p>You may not believe it yet, but you’ve already got what it takes within yourself to live a happier life.</p>\n<p>Let me show you how you can discover it.</p>\n<h3>This Is Me Today.</h3>\n<p>I am a Norwegian expat in Canada. Here, I live in the heart of the world’s most multicultural city, Toronto, and lead a happy and full life with my wife and our furkid. By so many standards around our globe, my lifestyle is privileged. It hasn’t come easy, and I often am reminded of how fortunate I am.</p>\n<p>I never could have envisioned living this life when I, one and a half decades ago, trapped, lost and without hope and goals for the future, decided on a whim to learn how to code and develop websites. I read about people making a living out of it, yet didn’t believe it was something I myself could do.</p>\n<blockquote><p>After a year of trying, failing and learning I began to prove myself wrong.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Today I work at XWP, a global company powered remotely by people working from their homes around the world. Our core expertise is WordPress. Our team dreams up and engineers platforms, tools and workflows that let companies more effortlessly connect with their audience. We help our clients to sell and deliver their services and product, and grow communities that serves as an extension of their businesses.</p>\n<p>XWP’s roots date back to 2004, and I’ve been part of the journey for 10 of those years. In my current role I serve a team of 40 people. I was fully entrusted with the care of the company and the people working there by its owner in 2014. I am responsible for guiding our company vision, strategy and direction while ensuring its healthy growth and great performance. A vital area of my mandate is helping each person on our team have meaningful, impactful work in a purpose filled role they can be successful in.</p>\n<p>The workplace environment and my role allows me to connect directly with my own professional purpose &#8211; to be a catalyst and energizer in helping people discover their personal and professional strengths, and uncover the opportunities and possibilities it can bring in their life. At work, I am also able to apply my strength of bringing people together to build unity and community.</p>\n<p>At home, I am at my happiest when spending time with my wife and our senior rescue lab. The love I give and receive, our deep and our silly conversations together, and all the laughs we share are things that fills me up and re-energizes me. Cooking and serving food, especially for a small crowd, also energizes me. I’m known for preparing elaborate meals with menus that can take days to plan to get “just right”. Earlier this year I completed a Culinary Arts program at George Brown College here in Toronto to further explore my passion for food and for service.</p>\n<p>My whole life I’ve found joy in doing sports. In my youth I actively played football/soccer and volleyball and did well with it. Since moving to Toronto I’ve taken up running, and I’ve discovered a way to keep myself motivated to exercise and train is to sign up for running races. It also has become a way I get to compete against myself, measuring my improvement to pace and finishing times. In 2015 I ran my first half-marathon. My goal was to run a full marathon this year, but I pushed myself too hard and strained a muscle, so I’ll run it next year instead. I am looking forward to passing that 42.2km mark in under 4 hours.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I lead my life guided by a set of deeply held values, principles and beliefs:</li>\n<li>I value compassion, kindness, care, integrity and authenticity.</li>\n<li>I believe in serving others before myself.</li>\n<li>I offer my trust from the very start of a relationship, choosing to believe everyone has good intent in their heart.</li>\n<li>I strive to listen to and understand others. This lets me be empathic which will help me serve others needs better.</li>\n<li>I am of the opinion that everyone deserves to live a happy, fulfilling life, regardless of any personal flaw.</li>\n<li>I recognize my flaws and build up my strengths around them.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I am so grateful to have discovered all of this about myself at an early stage in life so I can live authentically who I am today and embrace all the opportunities it is affording me.</p>\n<h3>When I Discovered My Strengths.</h3>\n<p>I was invited to join the team at XHTMLized (today known as XFive, and a sister company of XWP), as a front-end developer in 2006. There was no shortage of work, the demand for its PSD-to-HTML service was growing rapidly. Opportunities to be part of great projects with exciting brands kept coming my way, and I continued to hone and develop my skills as a developer and project lead. Opportunities to be part of building the company surfaced, and I began investing time into helping the business grow.</p>\n<p>Trying on and wearing the hats of different areas of the business was encouraged. I served in a variety of roles that touched on most every function of the business, including project management, sales and account management, finance and HR. I would often run into new and unfamiliar territory. Through my own determination I battled my fear of failure, and figured out how to do the things that needed to be done. I was surrounded by people who believed in me and recognized my strengths and achievements even when I wasn’t able to see them myself.</p>\n<p>It was here that my belief in trust, empowerment, collaboration and autonomy in the workplace was shaped because I was experiencing how powerful it was first hand.</p>\n<p>When our WordPress-focused team came together to form XWP in 2014, the opportunity to lead the company surfaced.</p>\n<p>While faced with startup jitters and challenges of building up a brand new business, and while working with a team of enormous potential, I became uncertain of my own place in it. I questioned my ability to add value, to set us up in a way that would help us fulfill our potential. I began questioning my professional future. To deal with this uncertainty, I chose to start working with a professional coach. It was a decision that would greatly alter how I viewed myself and where I was in my career.</p>\n<p>Through the work with my coach, I was introduced to the concept of <em>unique ability</em>, a belief that at the heart of who you are lies the secret to your greatest success, best quality of life, and biggest contribution to the world. It gave me new hope. I began the work to define my own unique ability. I discovered the concept of <em>Servant Leadership</em>, the understanding that leadership is not for personal power or gain but it is in service to others. This deeply resonated with me. I had seen traits of Servant Leadership in people I worked with and I was unknowingly applying aspects of it in my own life.</p>\n<p>Within 6 months of coaching I had made the decision to pursue the role I have in the company today. I was believing in myself again and recognized that I could continue to make meaningful contribution and impact at the workplace I already had.</p>\n<p>I am reminded of a quote that has served me well over the last decade of my life and often comes to mind at times when I forget my strengths:</p>\n<p>“You must do the thing you think you cannot do”. &#8211; Eleanor Roosevelt</p>\n<h3>A Personal Sidestory.</h3>\n<p>My biggest personal transformation to date began when I found myself at rock bottom.</p>\n<p>I was at a complete and utter dead end in most areas of my life when I chose to end a personal relationship that had kept me abroad in the U.S for 12 years. I had come to the realization that in order to have the positive change I needed for myself, I had to be the change. I found the courage within to take the action needed to close an unfulfilling and unhappy chapter of life.</p>\n<blockquote><p>To do that, I needed to break with almost everything around me and start fresh &#8211; and it was <em>terrifying.</em></p></blockquote>\n<p>And exhilarating. But mostly, it was just terrifying. I had to let go of people I had grown close to and become dependent on. I didn’t have money in my own pocket nor did I have a home of my own to go back to in Oslo. I put my pride aside and asked for help from my family and the company I was working for so I could do what I needed to do for myself. I renewed an expired passport. I booked a plane ticket. I made sure I met all requirements necessary to bring my little dog with me. I began shipping the few belongings I had back to Norway. And I prepared my closest friends and extended family there for my departure by asking for their support and understanding of my decision. It was one small step at the time, and each step helped move me forward.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Letting go of what I had then was one of the best decision I have ever made for myself. I gave myself permission to create a better life for myself.</p></blockquote>\n<p>A constant during this challenging period of my life was my remote work. It offered the flexibility I needed to relocate and start my next chapter.</p>\n<p>Back in Oslo, I settled into an apartment which my sister helped me find while I still was overseas and had been unable to travel. I took a few weeks off work, still conflicted with what I wanted out of life and worried about what the future would hold for me. During my leave of absence from work I was called upon to lead an onsite kick-off of a significant multisite WordPress migration project with an important client in Canada. In my mind, I was still in need of “me-time” to get my life in order. But I chose to embrace the opportunity to be there for our team and to serve our client together. It would be another life-changing decision. During my visit to Toronto, I met and fell in love with the person who would become my significant other.</p>\n<h3>Steps To Conquer Your Own Obstacles.</h3>\n<h4>Step 1: Commit To Becoming a Better You</h4>\n<p>I’ve learned through my personal and work experiences that nothing holds you back in life more than yourself. Life has taught me that who you aspire to be and what you want to do is within your reach. It’s within you.</p>\n<p>You can start a transformation that lets you move towards a happier, more fulfilling place by making a commitment to consciously and continuously learn and grow yourself.</p>\n<p>Welcome failures because they will provide you with new learning. You have the ability to overcome them.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Take care to hone skills you have acquired. Develop new skills you aspire to have.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Discover your strengths. Apply them and find ways to develop them further. Your strengths makes up your unique ability, and your unique ability is who you are and why you are here. Use it, it will be your biggest contribution to the world.</p>\n<p>Be your own hero and get out of your own way. When you do, new and often unexpected opportunities are revealed. And you’ll discover that your possibilities in life are limitless.</p>\n<h4>Step 2: Find an Encourager</h4>\n<p>When you are ready to start your own journey of transformation, or if you are in the middle of one now, it’s important to find someone who can be your encourager and your ally on that journey.</p>\n<p>Look for someone in your circle of family or friends, or within the community. If don’t have anyone, I would welcome the opportunity to get to know you and cheer you on!</p>\n<h4>Step 3: Let Yourself Be Inspired.</h4>\n<p>Below are the key resources that helped spark my transformation in significant ways, and has lead me to where I am today. They continue to be sources of inspiration, and I hope they can be yours, too.</p>\n<p><strong>Books</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://strengths.gallup.com/110242/about-book.aspx\">Strengths Based Leadership: Great Leaders, Teams, and Why People Follow</a><br />\n(Tom Rath)</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://uniqueability.com/\">Unique Ability: Creating the Life You Want</a><br />\n(Dan O&#8217;Sullivan, Catherine Nomura, Shannon Waller &amp; Julia Waller)</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.wireddifferently.coop\">Wired Differently<br />\n</a>(Vern Dosch, Wally Goulet &amp; Tracy Finneman)</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.amy-wallace.com/creativity-inc/\">Creativity Inc.: Overcoming the Unseen Forces That Stand in the Way of True Inspiration</a><br />\n(Ed Catmull &amp; Amy Wallace)</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.jimcollins.com/article_topics/articles/good-to-great.html\">Good to Great: Why Some Companies Make the Leap&#8230;And Others Don&#8217;t</a><br />\n(Jim Collins)</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.danpontefract.com/the-second-book/\">The Purpose Effect: Building Meaning in Yourself, Your Role and Your Organization</a><br />\n(Dan Pontefract)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Thought Leaders, Influencers &amp; Contributors to the Servant Leadership Community</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Cheryl Bachelder &#8211; follow <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CABachelder\">@CABachelder</a> (Popeyes)</li>\n<li>Art Barter &#8211; follow <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Art_Barter\">@Art_Barter</a> (Servant leadership Institute)</li>\n<li>Ken Blanchard &#8211; follow <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kenblanchard\">@kenblanchard</a> (The Ken Blanchard Companies)</li>\n<li>Garry Ridge &#8211; follow <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LearningMoment\">@LearningMoment</a> (WD-40)</li>\n<li>Kevin Monroe &#8211; follow <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kevin_monroe\">@kevin_monroe</a> (X Factor Consulting)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Giving Thanks.</h3>\n<p>I’d like to thank Topher DeRosia here at HeroPress for giving me the opportunity to share my story. It is against my nature to talk about myself to this extent, but I do it knowing it can serve others. To write my story, I’ve also had to move past my fear of being in the spotlight and accept there may be judgement passed. The reality is that no one will ever hold me to a higher standard or judge me harder than I do myself.</p>\n<p>A very special thanks goes out to my wife, Heather, who bore with me through the, at times, difficult writing process. She has opened my eyes to life’s possibilities. In her, I found a partner I wanted to journey with. She believes in me and helps me believe in myself, and she is my greatest ally and encourager. As I write these words, I recognize they will be published the week of our 4-year wedding anniversary. Our years together have been the very best of my life so far.</p>\n<p>I also want to offer a heartfelt thank you to another big ally and encourager, my coach and friend Jeff. He’s made me believe in pink fluffy unicorns dancing on rainbows, and I am so grateful for him coming into my life and having him be part of the journey.</p>\n<p>Lastly, I’d like to express my deepest gratitude to Dave and to the team at XWP. They have had and continue to have enormous impact on my life, and they hold a very special place in my heart. I look forward to continuing my journey with them.</p>\n<div class=\"rtsocial-container rtsocial-container-align-right rtsocial-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-twitter-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-twitter-horizontal-button\"><a title=\"Tweet: Conquering My Obstacles To Happiness\" class=\"rtsocial-twitter-button\" href=\"https://twitter.com/share?text=Conquering%20My%20Obstacles%20To%20Happiness&via=heropress&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fconquering-obstacles-happiness%2F\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-fb-horizontal fb-light\"><div class=\"rtsocial-fb-horizontal-button\"><a title=\"Like: Conquering My Obstacles To Happiness\" class=\"rtsocial-fb-button rtsocial-fb-like-light\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fconquering-obstacles-happiness%2F\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal-button\"><a class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-button\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fconquering-obstacles-happiness%2F&title=Conquering+My+Obstacles+To+Happiness\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Share: Conquering My Obstacles To Happiness\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal-button\"><a class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-button\" href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://heropress.com/essays/conquering-obstacles-happiness/&media=https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/110216-min-150x150.jpg&description=Conquering My Obstacles To Happiness\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Pin: Conquering My Obstacles To Happiness\"></a></div></div><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"perma-link\" href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/conquering-obstacles-happiness/\" title=\"Conquering My Obstacles To Happiness\"></a></div><p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/conquering-obstacles-happiness/\">Conquering My Obstacles To Happiness</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com\">HeroPress</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 02 Nov 2016 11:00:45 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:11:\"Tine Haugen\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:34;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:73:\"WPTavern: NaNoWriMo 2016 Kicks Off Today: Write Your Novel with WordPress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=63374\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:83:\"https://wptavern.com/nanowrimo-2016-kicks-off-today-write-your-novel-with-wordpress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:6194:\"<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/nanowrimo.jpg?ssl=1\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/nanowrimo.jpg?resize=1025%2C402&ssl=1\" alt=\"nanowrimo\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-63376\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://nanowrimo.org/\" target=\"_blank\">NaNoWriMo</a> (National Novel Writing Month) today kicks off its 18th year helping writers achieve their creative goals. The online event is organized by a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization that encourages participants to work towards writing a 50,000-word novel. Writers commit to posting their word counts to their profiles each day during the event, which runs from November 1-30.</p>\n<p>NaNoWriMo began in 1999 in the San Francisco Bay Area with just 21 writers and grew to 5,000 participants the following year, thanks to promotion from bloggers around the web. In 2015, the project had 431,626 participants, including 80,137 students and educators in the Young Writers Program.</p>\n<h3>WordPress Tools for NaNoWriMo</h3>\n<p>The NaNoWriMo website encourages writers to use their own materials for writing their novels, such as a word-processing program, typewriter, pen and paper, or whatever inspires the most creativity. WordPress is ideally suited for capturing your writing and keeping track of your word count. There are also several plugins that make it easy to break novels up into chapters and export your work into the proper formats for <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/how-to-self-publish-a-book-with-wordpress\" target=\"_blank\">self publishing with WordPress</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/nano-stats/\" target=\"_blank\">Nano Status</a> is a plugin created specifically for NaNoWriMo participants. Public accountability with word counts is one of the motivating factors for many writers who participate in the event, and Nano Stats makes it easy to display your progress in posts, pages, and sidebar widgets. It pulls in word count stats from the NaNoWriMo website for the username entered in the plugin&#8217;s settings.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/nano-stats.png?ssl=1\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/nano-stats.png?resize=616%2C359&ssl=1\" alt=\"nano-stats\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-63393\" /></a></p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/mybookprogress/\" target=\"_blank\">MyBookProgress</a> plugin is another option for tracking your novel&#8217;s progress and displaying stats. The plugin&#8217;s writing goals and deadline tracking features are customizable so it can also be used for other projects besides NaNoWriMo.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/mybookprogress-widget.png?ssl=1\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/mybookprogress-widget.png?resize=283%2C156&ssl=1\" alt=\"mybookprogress-widget\" class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-63396\" /></a>MyBookProgress allows users to upload cover images for their books and displays a progress bar using a widget or a shortcode. It also includes MailChimp integration so that readers can subscribe to get progress updates on a book.</p>\n<p>In addition to the customizable goal tracking, MyBookProgress comes with preset template for NaNoWriMo participants who are working to achieve the 50,000-word goal. Progress can be recorded directly inside WordPress for display on your own website, as opposed to having to sign into the NaNoWriMo website. The backend of the plugin includes a writing statistics dashboard to give you an idea of which day of the week is your most productive, and your average percentage per day/week/month. Users can easily share their progress to Facebook or Twitter directly from the plugin&#8217;s writing dashboard.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/MyBookProgress.png?ssl=1\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/MyBookProgress.png?resize=805%2C582&ssl=1\" alt=\"mybookprogress\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-63398\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/author-wordcount/\" target=\"_blank\">Author Wordcount</a> is a much simpler plugin that allows writers to display one or multiple works in progress via a widget. Current word count and expected (goal) word count can be entered in the admin on the plugin&#8217;s settings page. It also has a simple UI that fits in more seamlessly with WordPress than the MyBookProgress plugin.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/author-wordcount.png?ssl=1\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/author-wordcount.png?resize=932%2C1198&ssl=1\" alt=\"author-wordcount\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-63404\" /></a></p>\n<p>During the NaNoWriMo event&#8217;s 18-year history, nearly <a href=\"http://nanowrimo.org/published-wrimos\" target=\"_blank\">400 novels have been published</a> via traditional publishing houses. Participants have also self-published more than 200 novels. If you achieve your goal of finishing a novel and want to look into <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/how-to-self-publish-a-book-with-wordpress\" target=\"_blank\">self-publishing</a>, there are many tools that make it easy to export content hosted on both WordPress.com and self-hosted sites.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/plugins/anthologize/\" target=\"_blank\">Anthologize</a> plugin allows authors to publish their works in several ebook formats, including PDF, EPUB and TEI. <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/plugins/bookpress-client/\" target=\"_blank\">BookPress Client</a> is another free plugin  that organizes your writing into a custom post type so book posts won’t show up mixed with normal blog posts on your site. It supports both ePub and Kindle mobi formats. WordPress.com users can take advantage of services like <a href=\"http://www.fastpencil.com/\" target=\"_blank\">FastPencil</a> or <a href=\"http://blog2print.sharedbook.com/blogworld/printmyblog/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">Blog2Print</a> for importing their posts into different book reader and print formats.</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 01 Nov 2016 21:03:25 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:35;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:48:\"Mark Jaquith: The 4 best WordPress hosts of 2016\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:40:\"http://markjaquith.wordpress.com/?p=5235\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:74:\"https://markjaquith.wordpress.com/2016/11/01/best-wordpress-hosts-in-2016/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:6421:\"<p>As a seasoned WordPress developer, I am frequently asked what WordPress web hosts I recommend. There are so many solid choices now! The WordPress ecosystem is truly a bounty of choice in 2016. I could write an exhaustive comparison of all of the options, but these are called &#8220;exhaustive comparisons&#8221; for a reason. Let&#8217;s skip that, and I&#8217;ll just tell you the four WordPress hosts I recommend in five&nbsp;distinct tiers.</p>\n<p>Note that many of these hosts target a range of sites, from starter sites to enterprise sites, so I am picking the hosts that I think fit each tier of site&nbsp;<em>best</em>, even though they might also work for other kinds of sites.</p>\n<h2>Starter Site</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.siteground.com/wordpress-hosting.htm?afcode=d3f3dc4c98ccbebf43909e7d7971eca7&campaign=WordPress\">SiteGround</a> is one of my favorite WordPress hosting companies. They offer a range of hosting solutions, but their WordPress-tailored plans are a tremendously good value and have many WordPress-specific perks. Ask around the WordPress community — SiteGround&nbsp;is a well-respected company that works hard to win and retain the business of WordPress customers. Their plans start as low as $3.95 a month, which is an incredibly good deal. If you aren&#8217;t sure what you need, SiteGround is what I would choose.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.siteground.com/wordpress-hosting.htm?afcode=d3f3dc4c98ccbebf43909e7d7971eca7&campaign=WordPress\">Take a look at SiteGround&#8217;s WordPress hosting plans</a>.</p>\n<h2>Developer-Friendly Site</h2>\n<p>What if you know your way around WordPress, want things like Git and <a href=\"https://wp-cli.org/\">WP-CLI </a>access, or want advanced WordPress-friendly caching for your site? <a href=\"https://www.siteground.com/wordpress-hosting.htm?afcode=d3f3dc4c98ccbebf43909e7d7971eca7&campaign=WordPress\">SiteGround has you covered</a> there, too. Their GoGeek plan (currently $14.95 a month) offers all of these perks, unlimited sites, WordPress staging sites, and so much more. I love working with GoGeek-level SiteGround sites, because they work really well and give me access to all the tools that I need as a developer. Or, if you&#8217;re not a developer, but have hired one to work on your site, you may want to upgrade to GoGeek hosting so she can work at maximum efficiency.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.siteground.com/wordpress-hosting.htm?afcode=d3f3dc4c98ccbebf43909e7d7971eca7&campaign=WordPress\">Go sign up for SiteGround&#8217;s GoGeek WordPress hosting</a>.</p>\n<h2>Intermediate&nbsp;Site</h2>\n<p><a href=\"http://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=917225&u=1391570&m=41388&urllink=&afftrack=\">WP Engine</a>&nbsp;has been around since 2010, focuses entirely on WordPress hosting, and has established themself as a solid choice in the intermediate range. Their plans start at $29/month and include a 60-day money-back guarantee and free automated migration of your existing WordPress site. WP Engine&nbsp;also has more advanced hosting options, so they&#8217;re an option that could grow with you.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=917225&u=1391570&m=41388&urllink=&afftrack=\">Sign up for WP Engine using this link</a> and you&#8217;ll save 20% off your first payment.</p>\n<h2>Professional Site</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://pantheon.io/pricing\">Pantheon</a> got their start as a Drupal host, but have taken their innovative container-based hosting technology to the WordPress market. As a developer, I appreciate their Git-based development flow, their powerful &#8220;Terminus&#8221; command line client, and their built-in and dead-simple dev/test/live environments. On the higher level plans, you get &#8220;Multidev&#8221; which lets you spin up a sandboxed development environment for a specific Git branch.

I thought about how I answer if a friend or a client asks me for hosting advice. I found that I regarded sites as fitting in one of five categories. Then, I considered which hosts offer the best service and value in those categories, and picked these four hosts. After I had made my picks and written about their benefits, I went to see which of my picks had affiliate programs. Three of them did, and one did not. I used affiliate links for those that offered them, and a direct link for the one that did not. Using affiliate links to sign up for their service will earn me some money, but you can of course just go directly to their sites if you like. I stand by these recommendations, either way. I&#8217;ll write a new post in 2017 with my new picks.

Both messages contained a URL to <a href=\"http://www.baidu.com/\">Baidu</a> with my Skype username at the end. I immediately became suspicious and after a cursory search of Google, I discovered that I <a href=\"https://community.skype.com/t5/Security-Privacy-Trust-and/Link-to-quot-baidu-quot-website-sent-to-all-of-my-contacts/td-p/4461728/page/15\">wasn&#8217;t the only one</a> receiving these messages.</p>\n<a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/SkypeBaiduLink.png?ssl=1\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-63380\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/SkypeBaiduLink.png?resize=378%2C229&ssl=1\" alt=\"Baidu Links in Skype Messages\" /></a>Baidu Links in Skype Messages\n<p>According to a <a href=\"https://community.skype.com/t5/Security-Privacy-Trust-and/Spam-messages-amp-links-sent-from-your-account/td-p/4511001\">support document</a> published by Claudius, Community Manager at Skype, the accounts sending the messages are most likely compromised. The document offers a list of steps that includes, checking your computer for malware, changing passwords, and increasing the security of your Skype account.</p>\n<h2>Tips to Strengthen the Security of Your Skype Account</h2>\n<p>Microsoft recently made changes so that Skype, Office, Xbox, and other Microsoft services can be managed with a single account. If you haven&#8217;t <a href=\"https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA34657/one-account-for-skype-and-your-other-microsoft-services\">upgraded your Skype account</a> to a Microsoft account, visit <a href=\"https://account.microsoft.com/\">Microsoft&#8217;s account</a> page and enter your Skype username and password. You&#8217;ll be prompted to upgrade which can only be done once.</p>\n<p>Once upgraded, click on the Security and Privacy settings link. This is where you can change your password, add security information, and enable two-step verification.</p>\n<a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/TwoStepAuthentication.png?ssl=1\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-63384\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/TwoStepAuthentication.png?resize=445%2C171&ssl=1\" alt=\"Two Factor Authentication Enabled\" /></a>Two-Step Verification Enabled\n<p>It&#8217;s important to note that in recent years, there have been major data leaks where the login credentials of millions of people have been exposed to the public. If you use the same password on multiple sites, visit <a href=\"https://haveibeenpwned.com/\">Have I Been Pwned</a> and check to see if your password was leaked. If you see the Oh no — pwned! message, you should update your password immediately.</p>\n<h3>Create a New Primary Alias</h3>\n<p>In addition to changing passwords and turning on two-step verification, you should limit the aliases that are allowed to login to your account. By default, your Skype username is the primary alias. You should change this to an email address or a phone number and disable your Skype username. Allowing only one alias that&#8217;s different from your Skype username limits the amount of entry points into your account.</p>\n<h2>Keeping Tabs On Your Skype Account</h2>\n<p>One of the major benefits of upgrading a Skype account to a Microsoft account is the ability to view recent activity. To view the most recent activity, click the Security and Privacy link and click on the <strong>see my recent activity</strong> link.</p>\n<a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/SeeRecentActivity.png?ssl=1\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-63387\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/SeeRecentActivity.png?resize=1025%2C395&ssl=1\" alt=\"How to View Recent Activity\" /></a>How to View Recent Activity\n<p>This will inform you of successful and unsuccessful login attempts.

He identified <a href=\"https://github.com/wix/WordPress-Editor-Android\" target=\"_blank\">two</a> <a href=\"https://github.com/wix/react-native-wordpress-editor\" target=\"_blank\">repositories</a> that Wix forked in order to bring the GPL-licensed WordPress Rich Text Editor into its app.</p>\n<p>&#8220;If I were being charitable, I’d say, &#8216;The app’s editor is based on the WordPress mobile app’s editor.&#8217; Mullenweg said. &#8220;If I were being honest, I’d say that Wix copied WordPress without attribution, credit, or following the license.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Even though the Wix app is made up of different modules and libraries, the GPL requires that the entire application be GPL-licensed since Wix is distributing the app with GPL code in it. Open sourcing the entire app&#8217;s code under the GPL is the only way to resolve the license violation, according to Mullenweg.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Your app’s editor is built with stolen code, so your whole app is now in violation of the license,&#8221; Mullenweg said. Some took issue with use of the term &#8220;stolen code&#8221; in connection with public, open source repositories, but the effect is the same regardless of Wix&#8217;s intention. Wix distributed GPL code without respecting its license, putting new limitations on it instead of preserving its freedoms. That code was not legally available to be repurposed without following its license.</p>\n<p>&#8220;You’d probably be in the clear if you had used just the original editor we started with (ZSSRichTextEditor, MIT licensed),&#8221; Automattic&#8217;s General Counsel Paul Sieminski commented on the issue. &#8220;Instead, Wix took our version of the editor which has 1000+ original commits on top of the original MIT editor, that took more than a year to write. We improved it. A lot. And Wix took those improvements, used them in their app but then stripped out all of the important rights that they’re not legally allowed to take away.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Mullenweg called for Wix to release its entire mobile app under the GPL, as required by the license, and make the source code available so that others can build on it and learn from it.</p>\n<p>&#8220;If you want to close the door on innovation, Wix, that’s your decision to make — just write your own code,&#8221; Mullenweg said. &#8220;If you’re going to join the open source community, play by the open source rules.&#8221;</p>\n<h3>Wix CEO Responds, Neglects to Address GPL Licensing Issues</h3>\n<p>Mullenweg&#8217;s open letter to Wix took the company by surprise. Wix CEO Avishai Abrahami <a href=\"http://www.wix.com/blog/2016/10/dear-matt-mullenweg-an-open-letter-from-wix-coms-ceo-avishai-abrahami/\" target=\"_blank\">responded</a> the next day on the company&#8217;s blog with a tone that imposed an artificial sense of fraternity in order to make the original allegation appear to be an over reaction. &#8220;Wow, dude I did not even know we were fighting,&#8221; Abrahami said. He cited Wix&#8217;s manifold contributions to open source software on the company&#8217;s GitHub account and their admiration of WordPress&#8217; commitment to giving back.</p>\n<p>His artful deflection avoids the licensing issue completely and demonstrates a lack of understanding of the GPL:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Yes, we did use the WordPress open source library for a minor part of the application (that is the concept of open source right?), and everything we improved there or modified, we submitted back as open source, see here in this <a href=\"https://github.com/wix/react-native-wordpress-editor\" target=\"_blank\">link</a> – you should check it out, pretty cool way of using it on mobile native. I really think you guys can use it with your app (and it is open source, so you are welcome to use it for free). And, by the way, the part that we used was in fact developed by another and modified by you.</p></blockquote>\n<p>GPL compliance, however, requires more than a show of open source spirit. Abrahami did not address the requirement that the entire mobile app be released as GPL but offered a vague statement about sharing code.</p>\n<p>&#8220;If you need source code that we have, and we have not yet released, then, most likely we will be happy to share, you only need to ask,&#8221; Abrahami said. It is still unclear as to whether his statement means the company will release the entire mobile app under the GPL or not. However, the company indicated on Twitter that they will release the app on GitHub.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/yairwein\">@yairwein</a> We\'ll release the code on Github, where we also shared our previous projects: <a href=\"https://t.co/FBhp2Kd5wn\">https://t.co/FBhp2Kd5wn</a></p>\n<p>&mdash; Wix.com (@Wix) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Wix/status/792656290854174721\">October 30, 2016</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>The other option would be for the company to completely remove any GPL code from its app and use the original MIT-licensed library for the editor.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The WordPress GPL Rich Text component in question, is actually a wrapper around another Rich Text component named ZSSRichTextEditor which is licensed MIT,&#8221; Wix lead engineer Tal Kol said in the article he <a href=\"https://medium.com/@talkol/how-i-found-myself-accused-of-stealing-code-from-wordpress-a7350da9f9f2#.h5zgf9lnc\" target=\"_blank\">published</a> over the weekend. &#8220;In retrospect it would have been easier to use it directly.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Using the original library would stop the current GPL infringement but does not erase the fact that the company has already violated the license by distributing the code.</p>\n<p>Wix has not yet officially announced what it plans to do, but at the time of publishing the company continues to distribute GPL code inside its proprietary app.</p>\n<h3>Mullenweg Is Willing to Go to Court to Protect the GPL</h3>\n<p>According to the GNU.org GPL FAQ, the <a href=\"https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.en.html#WhoHasThePower\" target=\"_blank\">copyright holders of the software have the power to enforce the GPL</a>, as the license is a copyright license. Copyright holders are advised to inform developers of the GPL-covered software if they see a violation. With the GPLv2, the only way for license violators to receive back their rights after violation is to <a href=\"https://www.gnu.org/licenses/quick-guide-gplv3.en.html\" target=\"_blank\">petition the copyright holder</a>. Mullenweg has already identified a path to compliance for Wix.</p>\n<p>Although many in the open source community are itching for a definitive court case involving the GPL, Mullenweg said his preferred outcome is to see Wix open source its mobile app.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I would much rather they just release their app as GPL rather than have to get into a legal fight,&#8221; he <a href=\"https://ma.tt/2016/10/wix-and-the-gpl/#comment-586279\" target=\"_blank\">replied</a> to commenters on his blog.</p>\n<p>When I asked if he is willing to take the matter to court if Wix does not comply, Mullenweg said, &#8220;We would of course go to court to protect the GPL.&#8221; He also said that if Wix decides to pursue the other avenue, &#8220;removing the library would fix it going forward, but not for things that already infringed.&#8221; Mullenweg could not say what Automattic will or won&#8217;t do in a legal context regarding the past infringement, as the situation is still developing.</p>\n<p>This weekend&#8217;s debate between Mullenweg and Wix sparked discussions across social media platforms as well as blog post responses about how the the GPL affects the industry. It also shows how divisive the license can be even among open source software proponents. Mullenweg, who is known inside the WordPress community as a zealous defender of the GPL, has demonstrated a willingness to go to battle over <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/mullenweg-and-pearson-square-off-on-patents-gpl-and-trademarks\" target=\"_blank\">violations of the license in the past</a>.</p>\n<p>Many in the WordPress and Wix communities took issue with the public handling of the matter, but ultimately the controversy is not a personal matter between Mullenweg and Wix. The proprietary mobile app distributes GPL code that was the work of many contributors. WordPress&#8217; open source code was built from the hard work of people who were willing to give that time and energy because they believe in the project and the freedoms that its license guarantees. Wix&#8217;s disrespect of that license illegally co-opts those contributions for the company&#8217;s closed source app.</p>\n<h3>&#8220;My program will have liberty, or never be born.&#8221;</h3>\n<p>The GPL license is holistic in the sense that all parts of an application are connected &#8211; if one part bears the freedoms of the GPL, the entire app benefits from the GPL and must be therefore be open for all. The GPL is the reason WordPress exists and the reason why Mullenweg is so passionate about it. If b2/cafelog had not been GPL-licensed, Matt Mullenweg and Mike Little would not have been able to <a href=\"https://ma.tt/2003/01/the-blogging-software-dilemma/\" target=\"_blank\">build on it</a>.</p>\n<p>One of the questions in the GNU GPL FAQ asks, &#8220;<a href=\"https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.en.html#WhatIfSchool\" target=\"_blank\">What if my school might want to make my program into its own proprietary software product?</a>&#8221; This question addresses how many universities try to restrict the use of the knowledge and information they (and their students) develop, a problem that also exists in commercial businesses. The GNU recommendation for developers wanting to ensure their software is allowed to be GPL licensed is to raise the issue at the earliest possible stage for the most leverage:</p>\n<blockquote><p>So we recommend that you approach them when the program is only half-done, saying, &#8216;If you will agree to releasing this as free software, I will finish it.&#8217; Don&#8217;t think of this as a bluff. To prevail, you must have the courage to say, <strong>&#8216;My program will have liberty, or never be born.&#8217;</strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>This powerful sentiment is one that many GPL software contributors have adopted as a way of life. They contribute code on the basis that it will be passed on with all its freedoms. Taking GPL-licensed code and putting it in a proprietary app is an affront to their contributions.</p>\n<p>Wix CEO Avishai Abrahami&#8217;s casual response identifies both parties as open source proponents who are working to make the web a better place. This response misses the mark because it fails to recognize WordPress&#8217; 13-year history with the GPL and how deeply it has impacted the software&#8217;s trajectory and ability to make the web a better, more open place. This license and WordPress&#8217; commitment to user freedoms has been the project&#8217;s true north from its inception.</p>\n<p>When a project is given the GPL license, it makes that code and the license&#8217;s freedoms inseparable. Essentially, that code isn&#8217;t legally available to anyone without those freedoms in place. Regardless of whether Wix&#8217;s deflection of the issue is motivated by ignorance of the GPL or malicious intent, the company has to answer for its misuse of the software. The ball is now in Wix&#8217;s court &#8211; to comply with what the GPL license requires or take its own interpretation to court.</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 31 Oct 2016 21:23:33 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:39;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"Matt: Apples TV’s Struggles\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:22:\"https://ma.tt/?p=46916\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:43:\"https://ma.tt/2016/10/apples-tvs-struggles/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:983:\"<p><a href=\"http://joe-steel.com/2016-10-28-Apples-October-TV-Surprise.html\"><img class=\"  wp-image-46924 alignright\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/ma.tt/files/2016/10/apple-tv.jpg?resize=231%2C201&ssl=1\" alt=\"apple-tv.jpg\" /></a>Joseph Rosensteel has <a href=\"http://joe-steel.com/2016-10-28-Apples-October-TV-Surprise.html\">an outsider but savvy perspective on the updates and technology around Apple TV</a>.

Last week I downloaded the <a href=\"http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/wixcom-launches-wix-app-providing-a-powerful-mobile-operating-system-for-small-business-owners-store-owners-hoteliers-and-bloggers-around-the-world-300339448.html\">new Wix (closed, proprietary, non-open-sourced, non-GPL) mobile app</a>. I’m always interested to see how others tackle the challenge of building and editing websites from a mobile device.</p>\n<p>I started playing around with the editor, and felt… déjà vu. It was familiar. Like I had used it before.</p>\n<p>Turns out I had. Because it’s WordPress.</p>\n<p>If I were being charitable, I’d say, &#8220;The app&#8217;s editor is based on the WordPress mobile app&#8217;s editor.&#8221; If I were being honest, I&#8217;d say that Wix copied WordPress without attribution, credit, or following the license. The custom icons, the class names, even the bugs. You can see the <a href=\"https://github.com/wix/WordPress-Editor-Android\">forked</a><a href=\"https://github.com/wix/react-native-wordpress-editor\"> repositories</a> on GitHub complete with original commits from Alex and Maxime, two developers on Automattic’s mobile team. Wix has always borrowed liberally from WordPress &#8212; including their company name, which used to be Wixpress Ltd. &#8212; but this blatant rip-off and code theft is beyond anything I&#8217;ve seen before from a competitor.</p>\n<h3>Dear Wix,</h3>\n<p>This explicitly contravenes the GPL, which requires attribution and a corresponding GPL license on whatever you release publicly built on top of GPL code. The GPL is what has allowed WordPress to flourish, and that let us create this code. Your app&#8217;s editor is built with stolen code, so your whole app is now in violation of the license.</p>\n<p>I suppose we’ll take this as a compliment &#8212; I’m sure the hundreds of people who have contributed to WordPress Core and our mobile apps are flattered that you chose to build one of your company’s core features using our code. We’re also excited to see what great things you create with all the time you saved not having to write your own mobile editor.</p>\n<p>You know what’d be even more exciting? To see you abide by the GPL and release your source code back to the community that gave you that jump start.</p>\n<p>I’ve always said that <a href=\"https://ma.tt/2014/01/four-freedoms/\">the GPL isn’t about limits, it’s about possibilities</a>. In open source software, you trade some of your control as a developer to better serve the developer community and the people using your sites and products. I don’t think that’s a limit, I think it’s a way to make sure we encourage innovation and momentum. If you want to close the door on innovation, Wix, that’s your decision to make &#8212; just write your own code. If you’re going to join the open source community, play by the open source rules.</p>\n<p>Release your app under the GPL, and put the source code for your app up on GitHub so that we can all build on it, improve it, and learn from it.</p>\n<p>Love,<br />\nMatt and the open source community</p>\n<h3>An Update</h3>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.wix.com/blog/2016/10/dear-matt-mullenweg-an-open-letter-from-wix-coms-ceo-avishai-abrahami/\">CEO of Wix has posted a response on their blog</a>. I&#8217;ll also try to post my response it to the comments there. <a href=\"http://wpgarage.com/news-views/weak-wix-response-wordpress-gpl/\">Miriam Schwab also has a very good response</a>.</p>\n<blockquote><p>We were all very surprised by your post, as you have so many claims against us.</p>\n<p>Wow, dude I did not even know we were fighting.</p></blockquote>\n<p>It&#8217;s not a fight: the claim is that the Wix mobile apps distribute GPL code and aren&#8217;t themselves GPL, so they violate the license.</p>\n<blockquote><p>First, you say we have been taking from the open source community without giving back, well, of course, that isn’t true. Here is a list of 224 projects on our public <a href=\"https://github.com/wix\" target=\"_blank\">GitHub page</a>, and as you can see they are all dated before your post. We have not checked if WordPress is using them, but you are more than welcome to do so, some of them are pretty good.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Very glad your company has projects on GitHub! Thank you for the offer to use them; if we do, we&#8217;ll make sure to follow the license you&#8217;ve put on the code very carefully.</p>\n<p>Releasing other open source projects doesn&#8217;t mean that you can violate the license of the editor code you distributed in your mobile apps. To repeat my earlier points: since you distributed GPL code with your apps, the entire apps need to be released at GPL, not just your modifications to that one library.</p>\n<p>As <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=12828814\">this Hacker News comment put it</a>, &#8220;Open source is not a swap meet; you can&#8217;t violate a license if you voluntarily release some other code to make up for it.&#8221;</p>\n<blockquote><p>We always shared and admired your commitment to give back, which is exactly why we have those 224 open source projects, and thousands more bugs/improvements available to the open source community and we will release the app you saw as well.</p></blockquote>\n<p>If you were to release the entire source code of the apps under GPL that would bring you back into compliance with the license you violated. I <em>think</em> you&#8217;re saying you will do that here, but can you clarify? When should we look for the app code to be released, and where? That would resolve this issue completely.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Next, you talk about the Wix App being stolen from WordPress. There are more than 3 million lines of code in the Wix application, notably the hotels/blogs/chat/eCommerce/scheduling/booking is all our code.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I said the app includes stolen code. It doesn&#8217;t matter if it&#8217;s 30 lines or 30 million lines: because it includes GPL code and you distributed the app, the entire thing needs to be GPL. If you release the entire app&#8217;s code, as I think you said you would, then that resolves the license violation.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Yes, we did use the WordPress open source library for a minor part of the application (that is the concept of open source right?), and everything we improved there or modified, we submitted back as open source, see here in this <a href=\"https://github.com/wix/react-native-wordpress-editor\" target=\"_blank\">link</a> – you should check it out, pretty cool way of using it on mobile native. I really think you guys can use it with your app (and it is open source, so you are welcome to use it for free). And, by the way, the part that we used was in fact developed by another and modified by you.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Thank you for admitting you used the code and not trying to hide it. The issue isn&#8217;t the changes you made, it&#8217;s that including the editor means you need to submit the entire app as open source, which you have not yet &#8212; it&#8217;s completely proprietary.</p>\n<blockquote><p>If you want to read the account from Tal Kol, one of the leading engineers on this project, <a href=\"https://medium.com/@talkol/how-i-found-myself-accused-of-stealing-code-from-wordpress-a7350da9f9f2#.7yyylkagl\" target=\"_blank\">here it is</a>. He was really happy to share his side of the story.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I have seen it, and it <a href=\"https://medium.com/@csu/can-you-address-this-point-made-in-matts-post-this-explicitly-contravenes-the-gpl-which-7b6460b5b3e1\">already has a number of good comments on it, including this one</a>: &#8220;Can you address this point made in Matt’s post: &#8216;This explicitly contravenes the GPL, which requires attribution and a corresponding GPL license on whatever you release publicly built on top of GPL code&#8217;.&#8221; It appears you and Tal might share a misunderstanding of how the GPL works &#8212; software licensing can be tricky and many people make honest mistakes. (If you want to get into serious detail, <a href=\"https://ma.tt/2016/10/wix-and-the-gpl/#comment-586319\">this comment</a> lays the licensing requirements out clearly.) It is easy to rectify this one: release your apps as open source under the GPL.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Now, what is this thing about us stealing your branding? Our product was always called Wix and our website Wix.com, we never borrowed from your marketing or brand.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Sorry for including this distraction; I was referring specifically to the fact that Wix used to go by &#8220;Wixpress.&#8221; You can see this <a href=\"http://files.shareholder.com/downloads/AMDA-29IDMU/0x0xS1193125-13-387285/1576789/filing.pdf\">in your Form F-1</a>, and there used to be a support page about this on your site:</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-46910\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/ma.tt/files/2016/10/Screen-Shot-2016-10-30-at-3.12.19-AM.png?resize=604%2C94&ssl=1\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>Although that is still in Google, the <a href=\"https://www.wix.com/support/html5/ugc/62ae9410-79d0-4198-8ff1-4a37966e1e94/0d1a19e1-c862-44e4-a9d6-bc813f8a9207\">page</a> it links to <a href=\"https://cloudup.com/cu5miENIoLl\">now mysteriously returns a 404 error</a>, which you may want to look into.</p>\n<blockquote><p>In fact, if I remember correctly, until recently the Automattic home page was all about blogs and only recently it has become “websites.” Also, your business model changed to almost exactly the one we had for years. Can it be that you guys are borrowing from us? If so, again, you are welcome to it.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://automattic.com/\">Automattic home page</a> has been a series of haiku about our products <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20121218130226/http://wordpress.com/\">since 2009</a>, pretty much unchanged &#8212; I think you mean the WordPress.com home page here. WordPress has been used for creating websites, not just blogs, since <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2005/02/strayhorn/\">our 1.5 release in 2005 added themes and pages</a>. In my <a href=\"https://ma.tt/2014/10/sotw-2014/\">2014 State of the Word address</a> I talked about how 87% of WordPress sites use it as a CMS. We regularly test dozens of variations of the WP.com homepage and some of them definitely emphasize website creation. I will say we look to Wix, Weebly, and Squarespace as innovators in the space with products that reach many small businesses, and Wix especially should be commended for its success and growth as a public company.</p>\n<blockquote><p>If you believe that we need to give you credit, that you deserve credit, I must say, absolutely yes. You guys deserve a lot of credit, but not because of a few lines of source code, you deserve credit because you guys have been making the internet dramatically better, and for that we at Wix are big fans. We love what you have been trying to do, and are working very hard to add our own contribution to make the internet better.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Thank you very much, that is kind. I do think there are a lot of values we share in common and would love to see this one issue resolved.</p>\n<blockquote><p>If you need source code that we have, and we have not yet released, then, most likely we will be happy to share, you only need to ask. We share your belief that making the internet better, is best for everyone.</p></blockquote>\n<p>That&#8217;s what my post was asking, for you to release the code. To quote my original letter: &#8220;Release your app under the GPL, and put the source code for your app up on GitHub so that we can all build on it, improve it, and learn from it.&#8221;</p>\n<blockquote><p>Finally, during the last couple of years, I reached out a couple of times trying to meet with you. Could I do that again here? I believe in friendly competition, and as much fun as it is to chat over the blogosphere, maybe we can also do it over a cup of coffee?</p></blockquote>\n<p>Once this is resolved I&#8217;d be happy to meet up. I believe when we exchanged emails in 2014 there was trouble finding overlap in our travel schedules.</p>\n<p>I hope the above clarifies where we think Wix made a mistake, and how to fix it.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 28 Oct 2016 19:45:18 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4:\"Matt\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:41;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"Matt: Kanye McDonald’s Poem\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:22:\"https://ma.tt/?p=46881\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:43:\"https://ma.tt/2016/10/kanye-mcdonalds-poem/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:302:\"<p>You might need a reason to smile today.

The team has since <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2016/10/28/editor-changes-in-4-7/\">implemented</a> some of the suggestions outlined in <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/27159\">ticket #27159</a> into WordPress 4.7, including rearranging some of the toolbar buttons.

According to Andrew Ozz, who primarily works on the TinyMCE editor in WordPress, underlining text causes confusion as readers may interpret it as a link. The justify button was removed because it has uneven browser implementation and often makes text less readable. However, keyboard shortcuts for both buttons will continue to work in 4.7.</p>\n<a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/WP46FreshInstallPostEditor.png?ssl=1\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-60457\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/WP46FreshInstallPostEditor.png?resize=573%2C396&ssl=1\" alt=\"WordPress 4.6 Post Editor\" /></a>WordPress 4.6 Post Editor\n<a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/WordPress47PostEditor.png?ssl=1\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-63316\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/WordPress47PostEditor.png?resize=637%2C248&ssl=1\" alt=\"WordPress 4.7 Post Editor\" /></a>WordPress 4.7 Post Editor\n<p>In addition to these changes, tooltips that appear when hovering over a button will display the keyboard shortcut making them easier to discover.</p>\n<p>Since WordPress does not track which buttons are used most often the team can not accurately measure the impact these changes will have.

Core contributors are asking for testing and feedback on some of the larger items ahead of the official release, slated for <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/4-7/\" target=\"_blank\">December 6</a>.</p>\n<p>Twenty Seventeen and its support for atmospheric videos is one of the major front-facing features in 4.7 that could use testing. Last week, when <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/new-wordpress-default-theme-twenty-seventeen-merged-into-4-7\" target=\"_blank\">Twenty Seventeen was merged</a>, there was some uncertainty as to whether or not the first version would ship with video headers. Contributors knuckled down and worked quickly to get basic <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/38172\" target=\"_blank\">core support for video headers</a> ready for an initial commit.</p>\n<p>Twenty Seventeen will be the first WordPress theme to use the new feature. Users will be able to manage video headers in the customizer by selecting a video via the media library or setting a URL to an external video, such as one hosted on YouTube. Theme authors who want to add support for videos will be able to do so by passing &#8216;video&#8217; => true as an argument when adding theme support for custom headers. If the browser is unable to play the video, it will fallback to the header image.</p>\n<p>Other user-facing features that require testing include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>New site setup flow</li>\n<li>Custom CSS with live previews</li>\n<li>User admin languages</li>\n<li>PDF thumbnail previews</li>\n</ul>\n<p>WordPress 4.7 release lead Helen Hou-Sandí also requested that plugin and theme developers test the REST API content endpoints, any plugins that might be impacted by the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2016/09/08/wp_hook-next-generation-actions-and-filters/\" target=\"_blank\">WP_Hook overhaul</a>, the expanded Settings Registration API, custom bulk actions, post type templates, and a few other items.</p>\n<p>With the impressive list of features on deck for 4.7, it&#8217;s only fitting that Beta 1 was accompanied by an extended five-stanza haiku. Check out the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2016/10/wordpress-4-7-beta-1/\" target=\"_blank\">announcement post</a> to read the haiku and find more information on how to test changes coming in the next release.</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 28 Oct 2016 06:01:11 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:44;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:83:\"WPTavern: WordPress 4.7 Brings Custom Page Template Functionality to All Post Types\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=63284\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:94:\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-4-7-brings-custom-page-template-functionality-to-all-post-types\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3024:\"<a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/colored-pencils.jpg?ssl=1\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/colored-pencils.jpg?resize=1025%2C464&ssl=1\" alt=\"photo credit: Mari Pi\" class=\"size-full wp-image-50851\" /></a>photo credit: <a href=\"https://stocksnap.io/photo/7MBZIHU7O7\">Mari Pi</a>\n<p>WordPress 4.7 will <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/38951\" target=\"_blank\">introduce support for post type templates</a>, an exciting new feature for theme and plugin developers. <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/template-files-section/page-template-files/page-templates/\" target=\"_blank\">Page templates</a>, which allow developers to specify a different layout or design for a page, are nearly as old as WordPress itself. For years developers have coveted that same functionality for other post types. In fact, a plugin that attempted to create this functionality (<a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/custom-post-template/\" target=\"_blank\">Custom Post Template</a>), has more than 50,000 active installs, despite not having been updated for four years.</p>\n<p>Post type templates follow a format similar to that of the existing custom page templates. The author can specify a template name as well as the post types where the template will be available as a dropdown in the page attributes metabox. The current implementation of post type templates can be used with any post type without having to register support for page-attributes. The metabox will be displayed if at least one template exists for a post type.</p>\n<p><code>/*<br />\n * Template Name: Foggy Memories<br />\n * Template Post Type: memory, event<br />\n */</code></p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/18375\" target=\"_blank\">ticket</a> for the feature, which was opened four years ago, includes many potential use cases. One developer was building a project involving landing pages that were set up as custom post types. He needed to have multiple templates for the landing pages but had to create a work around since post type templates were not yet available.</p>\n<p>Another developer wanted to make a distinction between posts with guest contributors versus those coming from regular writers, such as displaying author boxes and avatars. Since this project was for a client, an implementation involving post templates would make it easy to assign the different designs via the dropdown in the post attributes metabox.</p>\n<p>&#8220;By opening up the page template functionality to all post types, we continue to improve the template hierarchy&#8217;s flexibility,&#8221; WordPress core committer Pascal Birchler said in his commit message. This new feature opens up many new avenues of customization for theme developers who want to offer alternative layouts and designs for posts. It also makes it easy to include multiple designs (inside a theme) for specific custom post types that a theme will support.</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 28 Oct 2016 04:35:50 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:45;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"Dev Blog: WordPress 4.7 Beta 1\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:34:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=4535\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:56:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2016/10/wordpress-4-7-beta-1/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:6878:\"<p>WordPress 4.7 Beta 1 is now available!</p>\n<p><strong>This software is still in development,</strong> so we don’t recommend you run it on a production site. Consider setting up a test site just to play with the new version. To test WordPress 4.7, try the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-beta-tester/\">WordPress Beta Tester</a> plugin (you’ll want “bleeding edge nightlies”). Or you can <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/wordpress-4.7-beta1.zip\">download the beta here</a> (zip).</p>\n<p>WordPress 4.7 is slated for release on <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/4-7/\">December 6</a>, but we need your help to get there. We&#8217;ve been working on a lot of things, many of them to make getting your site set up the way you want it much easier. Here are some of the bigger items to test and help us find as many bugs as possible in the coming weeks:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://2017.wordpress.net/\"><strong>Twenty Seventeen</strong></a> &#8211; A brand new default theme brings your site to life with immersive featured images, video headers, and subtle animations. With a focus on business sites, it features multiple sections on the front page as well as widgets, navigation and social menus, a logo, and more. Personalize its asymmetrical grid with a custom color scheme and showcase your multimedia content with post formats. Our default theme for 2017 works great in many languages, for any abilities, and on any device.</li>\n<li><strong>Video Headers</strong> &#8211; Sometimes a big atmospheric video as a moving header image is just what you need to showcase your wares; go ahead and try it out with Twenty Seventeen. Need some video inspiration? Try searching for sites with video headers available for download and use.</li>\n<li><strong>Set up your site in one flow</strong> &#8211; From finding and installing themes right inside the customizer, to automatically staged theme-specific starter content, to clickable shortcuts that jump directly to editing an item from the preview pane, to adding pages while you&#8217;re building a nav menu or setting a static front page: getting a new site spun up and ready to share with a friend or a coworker is faster and easier than it&#8217;s ever been. Note: starter content appears when live previewing brand new sites and is currently only available in Twenty Seventeen. We&#8217;ll be expanding this to other bundled themes very soon, and perhaps to sites with existing content in future releases of WordPress.</li>\n<li><strong>Custom CSS with live previews</strong> &#8211; Ever needed to hide or tweak the look of something in your theme or from a plugin? Now you can do it with CSS and live preview the results while customizing your site. CSS can be a powerful tool; you may find that you won&#8217;t need the theme editor or child themes anymore.</li>\n<li><strong>User admin languages</strong> &#8211; Just because your site is in one language doesn&#8217;t mean that everybody helping manage it prefers that language for their admin. To try this out, you&#8217;ll need to have more than one language installed, which will make a user language option available in your profile.</li>\n<li><strong>PDF thumbnail previews</strong> &#8211; Uploading PDFs will now generate thumbnail images so you can more easily distinguish between all your documents.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As always, there have been exciting changes for developers to explore as well, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>REST API content endpoints</strong> &#8211; If you only test one thing as a developer, please test these. This phase is particularly helpful for people building plugins, themes, and in-admin interfaces. Can you build the things you need? Are these ready for release, and is the world ready for them? (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/38373\">#38373</a>)</li>\n<li><strong><code>WP_Hook</code></strong> &#8211; The code that lies beneath actions and filters has been overhauled.

After <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordcamp-incubator-program-to-launch-in-indonesia-zimbabwe-and-columbia\">receiving 182 applications</a>, the three cities selected for the program were:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Denpasar, Indonesia</li>\n<li>Harare, Zimbabwe</li>\n<li>Medellín, Colombia</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"https://2016.medellin.wordcamp.org/\">WordCamp Medellín</a> is scheduled for November 5th and is the first of the three incubator events to take place. Andrea Middleton, Community Organizer for the WordPress open source project, is part of the organizing team and says organizing a camp from the other side of the world is challenging.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The local community is still quite loose/unstructured and there isn&#8217;t a very well-established group of local leaders, so it&#8217;s been an interesting exercise in finding local organizers, speakers, and volunteers,&#8221; Middleton told the Tavern.</p>\n<p>The organizing team consists of a U.S. expatriate who recently moved to the area, a Colombian who now lives in Spain, three locals, two members of the WordCamp Lima team who are lending their experience, and Middleton.</p>\n<p>Spanish is the primary language in Medellín which can present communication challenges. I asked Middleton if she needs to use a translator to communicate to the team, &#8220;I lived in Mexico for 5 years back in the 90s so my Spanish is passable, but it&#8217;s a pretty bilingual group,&#8221; Middleton said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The last meeting was in English but most of our text interaction is in Spanish to accommodate the Colombians who are not proficient in English.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I ask native Spanish speakers to review and or correct my written Spanish when I&#8217;m publishing content to the site. I&#8217;m the primary venue contact and all of that has been in Spanish over email.&#8221;</p>\n<p>According to Middleton, WhatsApp is huge in Colombia but is not ideal for collaborating with members of WordCamp Central since the team uses Slack. So half of the communication is on WhatsApp while the other is conducted on a free Slack instance.</p>\n<p>WordCamp Medellín&#8217;s <a href=\"https://2016.medellin.wordcamp.org/programa/\">schedule</a> includes sessions by local entrepreneurs on how to contribute to WordPress, Multilingual WordPress, and SEO. The opening session features a 15 year-old speaker.</p>\n<p>Thanks to considerable effort on the part of Middleton, the event has a female speaker, &#8220;We had no female speaker applicants, so I poured over the list of women who had attended the meetups and then researched them and recruited them to speak,&#8221; Middleton said. &#8220;It only ended up with one local female speaker, but I think she&#8217;s going to be great.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Middleton says that when the event concludes, she&#8217;ll publish a post detailing the things she&#8217;s learned organizing a WordCamp from abroad. Tickets are <a href=\"https://2016.medellin.wordcamp.org/registro/\">still on sale</a> for <a href=\"https://2016.medellin.wordcamp.org/\">WordCamp Medellín</a> at $10 each and includes lunch and a shirt.</p>\n<p>To learn more about Middleton&#8217;s role in WordCamps and the incubator program, listen to <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wpweekly-episode-234-all-things-wordcamp-with-andrea-middleton\">episode 234</a> of WordPress Weekly.</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 26 Oct 2016 21:11:27 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:48;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:104:\"WPTavern: Controversy Surrounding WordPress.org “Popular” Themes Exposes Weaknesses in the Algorithm\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=63129\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:109:\"https://wptavern.com/controversy-surrounding-wordpress-org-popular-themes-exposes-weaknesses-in-the-algorithm\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:10973:\"<a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/chart.jpg?ssl=1\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/chart.jpg?resize=1025%2C511&ssl=1\" alt=\"photo credit:  Luis Llerena\" class=\"size-full wp-image-46313\" /></a>photo credit:  <a href=\"https://stocksnap.io/photo/S3JE5YAMND\">Luis Llerena</a>\n<p>If you&#8217;ve ever wondered how the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/\" target=\"_blank\">WordPress Theme Directory</a> identifies and ranks the themes that display under the popular tab, you might be surprised to learn that it has nothing to do with ratings. Popularity is a somewhat subjective quality to measure in the first place, but WordPress.org has an algorithm in place to give users an idea of which themes are trending.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/theme-directory-popular-tab.png?ssl=1\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/theme-directory-popular-tab.png?resize=1025%2C775&ssl=1\" alt=\"theme-directory-popular-tab\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-63133\" /></a></p>\n<p>The number of sites using a theme is the first metric that comes to mind for popularity, but it cannot be limited to that or else the results might be skewed towards older themes that are not in fact popular anymore. Samuel &#8220;Otto&#8221; Wood, in response to a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mattmedeiros/status/791009700171087872\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter thread</a> about how themes appear to be gaming the system, created a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwFscqBOiOY&feature=youtu.be\" target=\"_blank\">video</a> to explain how the popularity algorithm works.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Popular is currently active installs divided by age of the theme and a few other factors,&#8221; Wood said. &#8220;Ratings don&#8217;t currently factor into it. We&#8217;re trying to work out an algorithm to add ratings to it. For the most part it&#8217;s a popularity thing.&#8221;</p>\n<p>I asked him for more clarification on the other factors and he said it varies depending on what data they have and how that data looks over time. &#8220;We adjust it to have it change fairly regularly, but still reflecting what is popular at the time,&#8221; Wood said.</p>\n<p>Dion Hulse, who also helps maintain WordPress.org infrastructure, said, &#8220;It&#8217;s not published by design, to hopefully prevent authors gaming it too much. Other than what Otto has said, they only other public part of it is that a theme must be at least two weeks old to be included in the popular rankings.&#8221;</p>\n<p>At the end of last year, <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/the-wordpress-theme-directory-replaces-download-counts-with-the-number-of-active-installs\" target=\"_blank\">theme download counts were replaced with the number of active installs</a> to try to prevent theme authors from gaming the system in order to appear on the Popular tab. Gaming the system is much more difficult now but there are other ways to do it, due to the imperfect measurements for active installs.</p>\n<h3>How WordPress.org Measures Active Installs for Themes</h3>\n<p>The topic of active installs was re-ignited yesterday by Matt Medeiros, a small business owner and <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/author/slocumstudio/\" target=\"_blank\">WordPress.org theme author</a>, who suspected the author of a recently popular theme of gaming the system.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Gaming .org theme downloads/active is running rampant. This theme “already has 10k active installs.” DL count roughly 3k <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Otto42\">@Otto42</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/aaYwWcsvu8\">pic.twitter.com/aaYwWcsvu8</a></p>\n<p>&mdash; Matt Medeiros (@mattmedeiros) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mattmedeiros/status/790940338030608384\">October 25, 2016</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/vertex/\" target=\"_blank\">Vertex</a> theme, new to the directory this month, already has more than 10,000 active installs, despite having a much lower download count and no ratings. Medeiros made a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XACFOft1hA\" target=\"_blank\">video</a> explaining what he perceived as suspicious activity propelling it to the fourth most popular spot on WordPress.org. This prompted Samuel Wood to film a response, which breaks down some of the flaws in the system that measures active installs.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The active install count is a count of sites that have reported to us that they are checking for an update for that theme and that it is active,&#8221; Wood said. He explained that the 10,000+ in this instance and in many others is a rough estimate because WordPress.org does not have an exact measurement of how many sites have installed a theme:</p>\n<blockquote><p>What we are actually counting is yes, the number of active installs of a theme named Vertex. That may include themes not in our directory, such as this one from Elegant themes. If the theme isn&#8217;t in our directory we still get reports about it. The only way for us to not do that is to have the theme itself that theme check them for updates instead of checking us for updates, which their theme should indeed do. I would go so far as to say that any commercial theme should indeed be checking their commercial site, their systems not ours, but if they don&#8217;t have any special code to handle that case, then yes it will report back to our API server looking for updates. And if it has the name Vertex then yes, it&#8217;s going to be counted as being the Vertex theme. </p></blockquote>\n<p>In this instance, the creators of the Vertex theme were made aware that the name was already in use outside of WordPress.org. They <a href=\"https://themes.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/30317\" target=\"_blank\">offered to change the name of the theme</a> to iVertex during the review process, but the Theme Review Team decided that it wasn&#8217;t necessary.</p>\n<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no gaming going on behind that,&#8221; Wood said. &#8220;If somebody does game the system, I will find it. I guarantee you. However, this is not such a case. Our current algorithm looks at active installs and if you happen to pick a name that is very popular [outside of WordPress.org], you can have a large number of active installs without it actually being this theme that is being counted.&#8221;</p>\n<p>This problem could be solved with a unique ID for themes. Wood said there is a six-year-old core ticket that he would like to implement, but it&#8217;s not currently a priority.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Unfortunately, there is no real push to do that,&#8221; he said. &#8220;At some point in the future, I would like all themes and plugins in the WordPress directory to get a unique ID which they can put in their headers and when they report back, having that unique ID will uniquely identify that theme or plugin. It would eliminate so many problems for me. It would make updates so much easier. I would be able to do a whole lot of useful things with it and it would let me fix this problem right here.&#8221;</p>\n<h3>How the Popular Themes Algorithm Affects Theme Businesses</h3>\n<p>Getting unique IDs in place is no easy fix, as theme reporting would need to be overhauled and multiple systems that interact with each other would need to be changed. It would be worth it in the long run for more accurate reporting on WordPress.org, which is the first place many users browse when looking for a new theme. If the active install counts are not a proper representation of installations via WordPress.org, then it doesn&#8217;t make sense to pin the popular algorithm to that number.</p>\n<p>I asked Matt Medeiros why he chose to highlight the situation with Vertex, and he explained why many small business owners have a strong interest in the popular themes page.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It’s getting harder and harder to survive as a theme shop these days,&#8221; Medeiros said. &#8220;Indie authors are overshadowed by huge theme shops and mega marketplaces. For me, .org is the only source of distribution for my themes, and I have a  desire to see the repo become the defacto place to find quality themes. Sadly, not all themes are submitted to &#8216;do it right&#8217; and many crop up to make a quick cash grab from unsuspecting end-users. Top spots are worth A LOT of money (see: Zerif) and coupled with an aging search engine for themes, gaming to the top is worth it, even in the short term. Unsuspecting users, who find searching too challenging, settle with what’s in front of them.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Medeiros referenced Zerif Lite, which was recently <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/zerif-lite-suspended-from-wordpress-theme-directory-300k-users-left-without-updates\" target=\"_blank\">removed from WordPress.org</a>, due to violations of guidelines that began to be enforced after the theme was approved. The theme was pulling in tens of thousands of dollars for ThemeIsle, thanks to its frequent spot among the most popular themes on WordPress.org. Ionut Neagu, the company&#8217;s CEO, estimates that Zerif Lite&#8217;s suspension from the directory will diminish the company’s $70K/month revenue by 50%.</p>\n<p>&#8220;There’s a lingering distaste in the review process for freemium upsells,&#8221; Medeiros said. &#8220;Not everyone agrees that folks should have an upsell product here, and that’s unfortunate. As a small business owner, that revenue helps me reinvest into the WordPress community, WordCamps, hire and train people in developing with WordPress. At times the review process, mixed with the emotions of others, feels like a rising tax against the small software business owner, like myself.&#8221;</p>\n<p>When drawing attention to the suspicious active install numbers for the Vertex theme and the flaws in the algorithm, Medeiros drew resistance from Wood, who does not see the directory as a place where businesses should expect a return for their investments.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The theme directory is not an advertisement to peddle your wares,&#8221; Wood <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Otto42/status/790999917451808768\" target=\"_blank\">said</a>. &#8220;It is exactly that sort of thinking [that] makes me want to ban all themes with a &#8216;paid&#8217; version from the directory entirely. The theme directory is not an advertising means. That is not its purpose. If that is your intent, then you are doing it wrong.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Medeiros said he isn&#8217;t interested in reviewing all themes for possible fraud, nor does he expect Otto to do the same. Vertex is just one example among many where the flaws in the algorithm are on public display.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I chose to highlight this issue because I think the repo can be a better choice for users than a for-profit marketplace,&#8221; Medeiros said. &#8220;Either way, I can only hope unearthing this conversation helps affect change for the better.&#8221;</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 26 Oct 2016 20:16:55 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:49;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:42:\"HeroPress: I fell.

I am a white, American male whom many would say lives a charmed life.</p>\n<p>I do not dispute that.</p>\n<p>However, that does not mean I have not faced adversity. My story is one of finding my own way &#8212; through trial and error, fierce independence, hard work, and lots and lots of ups and downs.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I was the kid who never knew what he wanted to be when he grew up.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I realized at an early age that I *could* do whatever I wanted to do; I also learned there was a huge difference between being able to do something and wanting or enjoying to do something.</p>\n<p>I was a pretty good all-around student &#8212; math, science, English and so forth &#8212; and was pushed toward pursuing a career with a big, important title like surgeon or attorney or chemist.

This was 1983 in rural Wisconsin!). When I reached high school, we had a shiny new Macintosh at home and it could dial into this thing called “The Internet.”</p>\n<p>I chose to attend <a href=\"http://www.drake.edu/\" target=\"_blank\">Drake University</a> in part because it offered an Internet-connected PowerMac in every dorm room. (I cannot overstate how revolutionary this was in the early and mid 1990s!). I majored in Broadcast Journalism, enjoyed it and went on to work in the news media for a couple years, but it took all of a few weeks on campus to because completely enamored with HTML and early iterations of CSS.</p>\n<p>I cobbled together a simple personal homepage using <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!_GeoCities\" target=\"_blank\">Geocities</a>, and when I got bored of posting personal tidbits surrounded by animated GIFs, turned to creating subpages for bands I liked. That morphed into creating a site dedicated to the Des Moines music scene. That site became pretty popular, mostly because it was 1998 and very few bands had their own website, much less one that looked professional and was updated regularly.</p>\n<p>I found that web designers were few and far between in those years, and was able to create small sites on the side for various businesses, groups and organizations as a way to make beer money. However the web was still very much like the Wild West and there was not a clear career path at that time for aspiring web designers, other than moving to Silicon Valley. I decided to pass and concentrate on completing my degree.</p>\n<h3>The years pass</h3>\n<p>Fast-forward about 10 years to 2012. I turned 35, and that milestone culminated in me quitting a job that I absolutely despised, not because of the job itself but because of the absolute tyrant of a “boss.”</p>\n<p>I had never walked away from employment in my adult life without knowing my next move. But this time it was necessary.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Every day I had to sit there I became more and more miserable to the point that it was affecting my marriage and mental health.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Luckily I had built a great personal and professional network and various job opportunities soon presented themselves. I began to think hard about finding a career rather than a mere job &#8212; something I could build upon and grow within. It’s what we all dream, but it seems that few achieve. I was determined to beat those odds.</p>\n<p>A close friend had recently left a communications position at a large utility about 40 miles from where I live, in a larger city with ample professional opportunity. I had always resisted looking for employment in that community, only because of the time it would take each day traveling to/from work. But, this was a very good-paying job that had essentially landed in my lap. My friend gave the workplace rave reviews, so everything seemed to be falling into place.</p>\n<p>I went through the whole rigmarole, interviewing several times with different people. Things were going well. It got to the point that on Friday, June 15, 2012, I received a call from the man whom would be my boss, letting me know that the field had been narrowed to me and one other person. He said as much as he was legally able, and reading through the lines, the job was mine. All I had to do was clear one final hurdle upon my return to Wisconsin.</p>\n<p>For the first time in months, I could see the future unfolding and it felt good.</p>\n<p>While my new “career” was not what I had expected to find I was perfectly content in my decisions. As I walked around Huntington Beach, CA that afternoon the cloudy skies gave way to beautiful, warm sunshine. I thought it was a sign that everything was going to be OK. I had no idea what was next.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\"><div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\n</div>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/L-73JpAzyo/\" target=\"_blank\">A photo posted by Eric  Kuznacic (@kuznacic)</a> on Jun 17, 2012 at 10:28am PDT</p>\n</div>\n</blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p><em>My hospital bracelet, one of the first things I recall seeing upon waking up from surgery</em></p>\n<h3>The Fall</h3>\n<p>I awoke the morning of June 16, 2012, with the intention of walking along the Pacific Ocean from La Jolla to Ocean Beach, CA. Once there my wife would pick me up after her meetings were over, marking the beginning of a few days of much-needed vacation time before heading home.</p>\n<p>I had spent hours carefully mapping out my route, creating a personal Google Map with all the places I wanted to stop for rest, a bite to eat and so forth, as well as where I could cut down side streets to/from the beach.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I thought I had it all planned out so well.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I set out from our hotel, which sits on a bluff high above the Pacific Ocean and abuts two world-caliber golf courses. Google Earth had shown me a route of how to get across the golf course and to a path that would lead me down to the beach below. All I had to do was hop a fence and I was home-free.</p>\n<p>Once over the fence I made a fateful decision to not follow my planned route, which would have taken me to a set of stairs that led to the beach. Instead I believed I had found a “shortcut” that would take me to the beach much more quickly and directly than my mapped route.</p>\n<p>Little did I know that this was what I later was told the locals refer to as a “false path.” I carefully made my way down the cliff, slipping a few times due to the loose gravel and the fact that I was wearing slip-on shoes &#8212; not the best choice for a steep hike. Undeterred, I continued down this path until I came to a spot where going back up was not an option (due to the cliff giving way), and going down further would definitely mean taking a tumble of some sort.</p>\n<p>My head swirled. What was I to do? Should I call 911? No, that would mean I’d have to admit I made a mistake and, I reckoned with myself, health insurance doesn’t pay for a cliffside rescue if there are no injuries. I tried and tried to climb back up, to no avail, until my clothes were completely drenched with sweat.</p>\n<p>Sensing futility, I sat down to rest. That 10 or so minutes gave me a lot to think about. People always ask me if death was on my mind. I can honestly say that thought never once crossed my mind. I began trying to rationalize one of the few choices I had: To jump to a point where I could safely slide down a ways on my butt, allowing me to continue down the cliff. What’s the worst that can happen, I thought; a broken arm and some scrapes.</p>\n<p>I decided this was my only choice and spent a few minutes pumping myself up. The plan was to launch myself from where I was stuck, trying to reach a rock that stuck out of the cliff, perhaps 6-8 feet away. If I could just grab onto that rock, I could gather myself before letting go in an attempt to let gravity do its thing. I snapped a couple photos of where I was at, just in case no one believed what was shaping up to be quite the story.</p>\n<p>I am not a religious man, but I said a silent prayer and went for it. I jumped as far as I could, getting my hands on the intended target rock, only to feel my fingers slip off. Down I went.</p>\n<blockquote><p>All I remember was smacking my face on the cliffside, then free-falling for what felt like an eternity, followed by a slide even further down.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I never lost consciousness, and when I came to a rest I was somehow able to adjust my body so that I was sitting up straight, faced with the most picturesque Pacific Ocean view imaginable.</p>\n<p>I screamed for help for a minute or two before realizing it was hopeless. I was still fairly high above the beach, it was windy, the waves were crashing against the shore, and there was no one directly below. It quickly became apparent that if I were to survive, it was up to me and only me.</p>\n<p>Upon gathering myself enough to realize the situation and that my injuries were very severe, my first fear was that I was paralyzed. My right leg was crumpled below me in a way that defies explanation and at first I could not feel it. My right shoe had slipped off in the fall, so I grabbed my right heel and found that there was feeling. That calmed me enough to be able to fish my phone out of my left pocket, something I could not have done had it been in my right pocket.</p>\n<p>I called 911 for the first time in my life. People from San Diego later told me that I should not have had reception in that spot, and sure enough when I later checked, the service map was white (no service) where I was. Miraculously the call went through and I spent the next 26 minutes on the phone with the operator. Luckily I knew right where I was and a lifeguard on a Waverunner was able to locate me and signal to others where I was at.</p>\n<a href=\"http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/eric-kuznacic-fall-aftermath.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1450\" src=\"http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/eric-kuznacic-fall-aftermath.jpg\" alt=\"This is how I looked the morning after my accident\" width=\"604\" height=\"453\" /></a>This is how I looked the morning after my accident\n<p>My right femur has been broken into three pieces. My right orbital bone was shattered &#8212; much like a windshield after being hit by a rock &#8212; as a result of my face slamming against the rocks. I was bleeding profusely from above my right eye and had serious scrapes and abrasions below the waist from sliding down the cliff after a free fall.</p>\n<p>At this point the adrenaline was pumping pretty good, but once my rescuers arrived I started to go into shock. They gave me a shot to counteract those effects, and I was able to tell them to call my wife to let her know I was OK. I still did not realize the extent of my injuries.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I thought I would be going to the ER and would be released later that day. I was wrong.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I spent the next three-and-a-half days in the hospital, followed by another day in a hotel awaiting our flight home to Wisconsin. Even though I was full of painkillers I was in more pain than I could ever have imagined.</p>\n<h3>The Aftermath</h3>\n<p>If you’ve read this far you might be wondering what this all has to do with WordPress. Needless to say, faced with a long recovery and unable to drive, I didn’t get that job with the utility.</p>\n<p>Once at home I was couch-bound for nearly four months as my leg slowly healed. I’ve never been a huge movie fan and one can only watch so much TV before becoming very bored. I convinced my wife that I needed a new laptop to pass the time.</p>\n<p>Two years earlier I had been introduced to WordPress via a non-profit organization whose board of directors I joined. They needed someone to keep their website up-to-date, and it just so happened they recently had converted it to WordPress. At that time I did not view WordPress as an avenue toward personal and professional freedom and satisfaction, but it certainly was easier than writing code by hand and scored points for being a handy and easy-to-understand tool.</p>\n<p>I have always been a fan and supporter of open-source software, and how digital collaboration has helped shape the Internet and world.</p>\n<blockquote><p>As I lay on that couch and as the summer days passed, I read up on WordPress. The more I read, the more it intrigued me.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I learned there was a thriving WordPress community of like-minded individuals, entrepreneurs and others making a living, and while I may not have known anyone locally, advice and assistance was readily available online.</p>\n<p>I dove in head-first, initially because I needed something to help pass the time during my recovery. As I learned and experimented, I came to view WordPress and website development as something that I could once again do to earn a little bit of money and help pay the bills.</p>\n<p>I had a pretty good local network due to my community volunteerism, and soon found a mid-size nonprofit organization who needed help maintaining its current website. That site was built upon some sort of proprietary CMS that did not work anywhere near as well as WordPress. After a few months, talk turned to building a new site and I strongly advocated for WordPress.</p>\n<p>It worked, and the rest, as they say, is history. I am not saying that the journey was an easy one; developing that first site was filled with missteps, mistakes and things I had to re-do several times.</p>\n<blockquote><p>But I was learning, I was independent, and I was making the best out of sitting on the couch 90 percent of the time.</p></blockquote>\n<p>That first project turned out well enough to impress the organization, and led them to suggest my services to others. Soon I had a handful of clients who turned to me because they had heard of this tool called WordPress but needed an “expert” to guide them. This led me to believe that this was a sustainable business, and perhaps could be the career that I had sought for so long.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\"><div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\n</div>\n<p> <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/ic0Qexgz91/\" target=\"_blank\">Always good to be in #oceanbeach #sandiego</a></p>\n<p>A photo posted by Eric  Kuznacic (@kuznacic) on Dec 27, 2013 at 7:29pm PST</p>\n</div>\n</blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p><em>How I feel every day when I wake up and realize I am my own boss</em></p>\n<h3>What WordPress means to me</h3>\n<p>I love everything about WordPress, but also realize that I am nowhere close to mastering this wonderful tool. I think that is what drives me to get up every morning &#8212; the chance to learn something new, to solve a problem, to seek out solutions, to expand my skill set for future projects. And, most importantly, WordPress provides me a vehicle through which I am able to set my own course, be my own boss, and build things my own way.</p>\n<p>I love the WordPress community and all those whom I have met or interacted. You are some very, very smart people! I relish the chance to extend my interest in volunteerism to the WordPress community, giving back to those who are just learning. I have attended WordCamps near and far, and in January 2016 founded a <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/Janesville-Area-WordPress-Users\" target=\"_blank\">local WordPress Meetup group</a> in the city where I live. I also spent three semesters teaching &#8220;WordPress 101&#8221; at the local technical college. These experiences, all because of WordPress, introduced me to others locally who share my love of WordPress.</p>\n<p>I officially launched <a href=\"https://www.wtftechsolutions.com\" target=\"_blank\">Why The Fuss? Technical Solutions</a>, my one-man design and development shop, on June 1, 2013, just two weeks shy of the one-year anniversary of my accident. I have been asked why I did not wait until June 16 to launch as a symbolic date. I have never before really told anyone why.</p>\n<p>The doctors told me it would be a full 12 months before I was fully back up on my feet. I viewed launching my business as a way to prove to myself that while time frame was accurate, on June 16, 2013 I wanted to be able to look back at what the previous year had laid bare for me with a positive outlook toward the future.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I am well aware of the fact that I do not know everything there is to know, about WordPress or life in general. But this excites me and drives me to do more.</p></blockquote>\n<p>In the past this type of situation would have driven me crazy, as I did not have such a heavy investment in whatever I was doing; it was just a job.</p>\n<p>WordPress has helped me find a career, one I never would have found if not for a series of unfortunate events and fateful decisions. I look forward to continuing this journey of personal and professional fulfillment.</p>\n<div class=\"rtsocial-container rtsocial-container-align-right rtsocial-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-twitter-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-twitter-horizontal-button\"><a title=\"Tweet: I fell.

While we have no maximum age limit, guests should be physically fit and able to climb in and out of sampans and excursion boats, and walk up (sometimes steep) hills in ports where docks are not available. MRC ships do not have elevators, and guests must be able to navigate multiple flights of steps.\r\n\r\n<strong>Are MRC cruises handicapped accessible?</strong>\r\nMRC ships are not handicapped accessible and do not have elevators. Many of the sites we visit have not been adapted to be handicapped accessible, nor have the transportation systems that are available in these areas. In most situations we are unable to provide individual assistance to travelers with mobility issues.\r\n\r\n<strong>Will MRC help me with additional arrangements if I wish to extend my stay before and/or after the cruise?</strong>\r\nMRC offers pre- and post-cruise land extensions to each of our cruises. Details of each extension are available in the Land Extensions section of the website, as well as within each ship’s information. MRC will also be pleased to assist you in extending your extension stay in our selected land program hotels.\r\n\r\n<strong>Do I need a passport and visa to participate in your cruise programs?</strong>\r\nWhenever traveling outside your home country, a passport is required. Some countries also require a visa. In order to determine if you need a visit to visit a specific country, you may visit an embassy website for the particular country, or contact our recommended visa service G3 Visas if you need assistance in obtaining your visa(s).\r\n\r\n<strong>What information do I get before my cruise?</strong>\r\nApproximately two weeks prior to departure, MRC will provide your final travel documents, which includes an itinerary, information on any land extensions booked, and any air tickets booked through us.\r\n\r\n<strong>What amenities are available on board?</strong>\r\nSome amenities vary by ship, but are listed in each ship’s information on the website.\r\n\r\n<strong>Is Internet available on the ships?</strong>\r\nMRC makes Internet available on board all our ships, but is provided by 3G networks, and a signal is not always accessible in all areas of the rivers.\r\n\r\n<strong>Can I use my cell phone on board the ship?</strong>\r\nThere is cell service in many places we operate, but not everywhere.

Please contact us for information on your particular dietetic requirements.\r\n\r\n<strong>Do I need travel insurance?</strong>\r\nTravel insurance is not required to participate in a MRC cruise program, but it is highly recommended, especially when considering the remote nature of some of our programs. Policies may provide you with peace of mind that you, your luggage, your cruise investment, and even your loved ones are protected in the event that something unexpected may occur. While travel insurance is available through many sources, MRC recommends Travel Insurance Services for US and Canadian residents.\r\n\r\n<strong>Are there any luggage restrictions?</strong>\r\nIn addition to any restrictions that may be imposed by your airlines (intra-Asia flights are typically restricted to 20kg per person total limit on checked luggage), MRC recommends bringing only one checked bag per person, as the storage space in cabins is limited.\r\n\r\n<strong>What is the dress code during the cruise?</strong>\r\nWhile MRC is proud of our commitment to luxury, we do not require formal dress. Our destinations are usually warm, with some cool evenings, and it is our goal for our guests to remain. We are also committed to proper hygiene, and therefore, it is required that guests always be fully dressed, with shoes, at all times in the dining room and bar.\r\nMany temples, pagodas, and other sites on our itineraries will require guests to have their knees and shoulders covered, and may also require guests to remove their shoes.\r\n\r\n<strong>What are the tipping guidelines for my cruise?</strong>\r\nGratuities for baggage handling during transfers and at our program hotels are included in the price of your program. While tipping is a very personal matter, we suggest the following guidelines for other gratuities during your trip:\r\nShip staff &amp; crew: <strong>$13.50</strong> per person, per night (given at the end of the cruise)\r\nLocal guides: <strong>$6</strong> per person, per night (given at the end of each person\'s service)\r\nLocal transportation or transfers: <strong>$1</strong> per guest, per excursion, or <strong>$2 to $3</strong> per guest, per service for long coach transfers (given at the end of each person\'s service) please note that transportation types may vary, based on which river you are sailing\r\n\r\n<strong>Can I prepay my gratuities?</strong>\r\nUnfortunately, no.

The first step is to ban motorbikes from the city center during weekends and public holidays by 2020. The restriction is expected to expand to week days after a year.\r\n\r\nHanoi will impose a downtown traffic ban for non-residential motorbikes from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m by 2021, and that will be expanded to the outskirts of the city by 2025.\r\n\r\nRoad tolls are also expected to divert private car drivers to other modes of transport.\r\n\r\nHowever, passenger numbers on Hanoi’s buses fell by 8.5 percent last year, according to Nguyen Cong Nhat, deputy head of the city’s largest bus operator Transerco.\r\n\r\nLow-quality services are the reason for this fall in numbers, the Vietnam News Agency reported.\r\n\r\nNhat said that in countries like South Korea and Singapore, public buses and coaches operate on exclusive bus lanes, but in Hanoi, only a mere 1.3 kilometers of some 500 kilometers is dedicated to buses in the city.\r\n\r\nAnother issue appears to be the lack of bus stops. In theory, there should be a stop every 700-800m, but many residents kick up a fuss when a stop is planned outside their houses, so in reality, this isn’t the case.\r\n\r\nHanoi’s Transport Department has laid out a map to develop a comprehensive public transport system by 2020, with investments in 600 new buses per year, three high-quality bus rapid transit routes and five elevated urban train routes.\r\n\r\nBy taking these steps, the city hopes people will be encouraged to leave their cars and motorbikes at home and switch to public transport or bicycles. However, Hanoi is still a long way from completing an effective public transport system.\r\n\r\nOnly 11 out of 83 bus routes in the city are run privately without financial support, according to Nguyen Trong Thong, chairman of the Hanoi Association of Public Transport.\r\n\r\n“Hanoi grants subsidies based on the number of trips the buses make rather than the number of passengers they transport, so bus companies have no motivation to improve service quality,” Thong said.\r\n\r\nJapanese transport experts said that the city should deploy e-tickets to monitor the number of passengers and calculate subsidies based on that.\r\n\r\nTicket prices have also remained at VND7,000-9,000 despite spiraling oil prices – another factor that is putting potential passengers off.', 'CHOKING STREETS FORCE HANOI TO MULL BAN ON MORE VEHICLES FROM CITY CENTER', '', 'publish', 'closed', 'closed', '', 'choking-streets-force-hanoi-mull-ban-vehicles-city-center', '', '', '2016-09-20 11:49:30', '2016-09-20 11:49:30', '', '0', 'https://www.vietprincess.com/?post_type=mrc_news&#038;p=495', '0', 'mrc_news', '', '0');

It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged.

Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for \'lorem ipsum\' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy.

The sensation is quite remarkable as the vessel cruises at an average speed of 8 knots (15kmh) and guests hear only the water lapping on the ships hull, or even daily life onshore, as we pass the riverbank residents going about their normal daily way of life.\n\nAny sixty-five meter river vessel is a spacious cruising platform and by design, can easily accommodate in excess of seventy guests. Founders of Mekong Rover Cruiser and Viet Cruises have stayed true to their philosophy of providing guests with a small intimate and personable space from which to truly experience and enjoy The Mekong River journeys.\n\nSeasoned Asian travellers will be familiar with the day to day language barriers that often prevent that spontaneous interaction with a local, more often concluded with a wry smile and little more.
